Last night I hosted a Developer Experience meetup at The Book Club in Shoreditch.

Thanks to everyone who came along - I think we all had a great time!

There were some awesome conversations, about everything from events to demos, presentations, best practices, getting developers recognition in your org, and so much more.

We also talked about building great APIs (and some examples of good APIs too), providing developers with the right documentation and tooling, and making integration easier (make example code include API keys, for example).

On top of this, [import.io](https://import.io) were kind enough to provide drinks and some fantastic food:

There are more pictures on our [Google+ event page](https://plus.google.com/events/cfo09qoab4roltrbp5ir8tnjh38) - if you're interested in #DevExp and other such things, come along to the next event which we are starting to plan now!
