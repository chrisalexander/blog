So one of the biggest stories in technology this week was the release of Windows 7, Microsoft's brand new operating system.

It would simply have been rude of me not to mention it in at least one post this week, and there are plenty of topics here to make sure you have the best start possible with the new operating system.

## Windows 7 for Students

Next up, it wouldn't have been that useful for me to point you to Windows 7 if I did not give you some idea as to why you might want it! [Windows 7 for Students](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/543) was very popular, and provides a great way for students who have just got the new operating system to get it working hard for them.
