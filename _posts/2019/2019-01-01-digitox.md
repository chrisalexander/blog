Dear reader,

Happy New Year! I think it's time to spend a bit less time on our smartphones - so I got a new phone for Christmas and I'm going to give it a try.

Along the way, I'd love to tell you about how it's going - perhaps so you can save a bit of time and money too. I'd like to send you all hand-written letters, but I think it might be a bit too much to take on!

Instead, I will still write to you the old-fashioned way, but send it to you by e-mail. If you'd like to start receiving it, please sign up at:

Best wishes for 2019!

Chris
