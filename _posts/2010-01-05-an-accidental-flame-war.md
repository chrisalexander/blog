I've been having a few technical problems with my Macbook - when I try and boot it into OS X, it gets half way through loading, then turns itself off (fortunately Windows 7 was also installed to save the day).

Given my somewhat limited OS X knowledge, I thought it would be a great idea to "crowdsource" a solution, and asked my Twitter followers what I could do about fixing it. The results were... unhelpful (at least to start with).

It started off so simply, with this perfectly innocent tweet:

*My macbook won't boot into OS X any more. Recovery options?*

... which was met by this torrent of flame:

*@chris_alexander Rejoice and boot it in to Windows 7?* - @nicktelford

*@chris_alexander Bin it and buy that custom-colour Mac Book Air off @nicktelford he won earlier?* - @domwrap referring to an earlier spam tweet

*@chris_alexander Have to agree with @nicktelford there.* - @joshmcgregor

*@chris_alexander Install an operating system on it? :-)* - @patparslow

*@chris_alexander "Kill it with fire" an option?* - @mangek009

*@chris_alexander rejoice?* - @emmaguy

... and just clinging on to his dignity:

*I nearly replied...nearly... it was just unintended troll-bate really* - @_andrew_harvey_

Fortunately there were some useful comments in there, and hopefully with @PCurd, @cookiecut and @IanField90â€²s help I will soon have it back and running again.
