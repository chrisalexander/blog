If you were at last week's #RDGTweetup you would have noticed me waving my new [Flip Ultra HD](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/858) around and shooting a bit of content.

Well I've finally managed to get it together and edited into a nice package. About 20 minutes of video and 2 hours of editing (then a further 2 hours getting it in a format suitable to present to you here) I am pleased to present the finished video!

If you spot yourself in this video, please leave a comment below and I will add you to the list of people who are in it!
