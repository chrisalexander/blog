I've just downloaded Google Chrome, the new browser from Google that was leaked yesterday and released as [public beta today](http://www.google.com/chrome).

First impressions - well its the fastest thing I've ever seen. Ever! I have honestly never seen anything run this fast, not even Firefox 3.

Mind you, fastest doesn't mean best - there's some things that could do with changing already. Not so sure on the greying-out of bits of the URL (like http:// and all the arguments on the end) and the yellow border around the current input box is also gonna get on my nerves quite quickly. These ads are also going to have to go at some point.

I'll keep how its going updated as I'm trying it out today!
