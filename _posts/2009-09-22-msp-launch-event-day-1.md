I don't know about you, but there's nothing quite like a 2-day launch event to really get something started.

This year is no different, with the launch of the MSP Programme in the UK taking part at Microsoft TVP.

Yesterday was day one of the launch, and featured two sets of excellent events.

First up was an excellent overview of Windows Azure and what we can expect over the next few weeks from David Gristwood, also known as @ScroffTheBad. I would tell you more but I've been signing bits of paper again so you'll have to wait until you hear it from Microsoft themselves!

The afternoon saw another excellent presentation training session by [Nicholas Bate](http://www.nicholasbate.typepad.com/), someone whose training sessions I have been in before and I thoroughly enjoyed once again. I always seem to take away so much valuable information from his sessions and once again this was the same.

From the Agenda it looks like today is going to be another excellent day, and I look forward to telling you all (as much as I can!!) about it.
