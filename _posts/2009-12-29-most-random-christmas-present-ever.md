So Christmas has been and gone, and the blog has remained silent.

No more.

For one of my friends obtained what can only be described as the "Most Random Christmas Present Ever". Words and phrases like "unusual", "inappropriate", "off-the-wall", "extreme" and "what on Earth was he thinking?!" all come to mind but do not even come close to accurately describing this present.

It is, the vibrating banana.

Quite why, I'm not sure. All I know is that it is made of some foamy substance, is bendable, and when you pull the cord it starts vibrating.

## LOL, wat??

So, can you do better?

Comment below with the most random / inappropriate / off-topic present that you got or saw someone receive this Christmas. Winner will get some chocolate or something.
