I'm (still) playing around with Chrome apps and extensions - and having fun doing it.

However there appears to be a lot of confusion around doing simple tasks. These are:

* <span style="line-height: 13px;">Getting the app / extension version string</span>
* Getting the app / extension ID
* Getting the app / extension manifest file

Various hacks involved using xhr to get the manifest file from the extension's resources, and all kinds of brutal things.

Here I outline (finally) the definitive, clean, consistently supported way to do these things.

#### Get the Chrome application or extension manifest

You could have any number of reasons for finding out exactly what your manifest file includes.

The definitive way:

    chrome.runtime.getManifest()

#### Get the Chrome application or extension version

This version is the one you set in the manifest file. Good for lots of reasons - checking you're up to date, grabbing versioned external resources, the list goes on.

The definitive way:

    chrome.runtime.getManifest().version

#### Get the Chrome application or extension ID

The ID for an extension is automatically generated by Chrome. You could need it for a variety of reasons, for example cross-extension messaging.

The definitive way is a bit trickier but well supported:

    chrome.i18n.getMessage("@@extension_id")

There you go.
