This is just a short one to say thanks to everybody who has ever given me useful feedback on my recent presentation spree. Useful, of course, means both positive and negative.

Often people won't say anything following a presentation, but I welcome all questions, comments and criticism - it's the sign of a good presentation. Additionally, often people mention things or ask questions that I had overlooked, not thought of, or had taken for granted. That feedback then directly contributes to making the presentation better the next time.

The feedback I find most useful is that on my presentation style. Following my (last-minute) talk at Reading Geek Night 11 I had some great feedback from a few people who really noted down where I was strong and weak while talking. When you're in the swing of things and busy trying to remember the points you were trying to bring across it is often difficult if not impossible to remember what you *actually* said to criticise yourself afterwards. So please, if you see me speak, don't hesitate to tell me what I did right and what I did wrong!
