Last weekend I went back home for a couple of days to catch up and see a few things. Cleverly (or not so) I left my phone charger there, and so had been without it for 2 days, and without a phone with charge since first thing yesterday morning.

Initially I thought this wouldn't be a problem - there are phones at work and home, and there's always Twitter, Facebook, E-Mail and a multitude of other ways of connecting and staying in touch. *Wrong.*

It turns out there's nothing quite like having a device in your pocket that can access just about anything with the press of a couple of buttons. While I was still able to access Twitter, Facebook and the like, simply the knowledge that I didn't have access to these services and others in my pocket seemed to make everything more difficult.

In todays connected age more and more people make use of â€˜on demand' services like these; and being without them made day to day tasks more difficult. Hopefully the experience won't be repeated.
