There's something quite magical about [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/).

First of all, that a desktop app has survived in Google's portfolio for 10 years
(it was bought from Lifescape in 2004) is quite special.

Anyone remember Google Desktop, for example?

But in a world of Photoshops, Flickr, Aperture, the Cloud and ever-increasing
megapixels, Picasa offers simplicity, speed, and great organisation capabilities
combined with some absolutely wicked face recognition kit and powerful search.

Sure it has its drawbacks. Google+ photo sharing does feel like it was bolted
on in a bit of a rush (as did the Picasa Web product before it). The face
training UX leaves a little to be desired. And the interop between Picasa and
other applications is basically deferred to the OS.

But with the rumoured reshuffle in Google+, including the potential split out
of Photos having only just made it over from Picasa Web, I hope that whoever
has been vociferously campaigning for Picasa's survival this long inside Google
keeps going through this next transition.
