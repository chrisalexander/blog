Management courses, books, blogs and all kinds of content are full of acronyms. This is rather unfortunate for me, my memory is something of a sieve, and so I find it rather tricky to keep what the acronyms stand for in my mind.

SMART goals come up incredibly often, and remembering exactly what each bit of the acronym means when creating a goal is quite tricky for me. So in order to try and resolve this (in addition to my post-it on my desk and page in my OneNote with it on), I created some images to help me remember. Good job I have a lot of Lego in stock!
