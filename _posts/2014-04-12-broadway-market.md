We have lived in Hackney for some time now (going on 2 years!) and we regularly go through Broadway Market.

In fact, I go through it twice a day, getting to work and back. In addition, we go when the market itself is on, Saturday lunchtime.

However, up until now, we've gone for the food (trust me, it's delicious) - today we went with cameras, and I tried to capture what I think of as the market.

In addition to great lunchtime food, there is plenty of fresh produce and things to take home. Tomatoes from the Isle of Wight, fresh fruit and veg, and various prepared foods such as these giant baked beans.

Or, you can take home a whole chicken from the hog roast stall - we keep meaning to do this! But there is so much choice at the market, it is hard to remember such things; sometimes we don't even make it to the other end!

If you want lunch, you're spoilt for choice. There's something for everyone, ranging from burgers to pies, local favourites to cuisine from afar.

Among the great choices not listed here include various muchroom salads, crepes with all kinds of toppings, the freshest possible smoothies (they peel the fruit in front of you before it gets blitzed), and more.

# Equipment

I didn't take out my entire kit this time, in fact I didn't even take the camera bag.

I took off the battery pack, so my little EOS 1000D actually looked *very* little. I also put on the 40mm fixed pancake lens, which is even tinier than the 50mm prime, and I ended up with something that was virtually as small as the EOS M that Wenni was carrying around.

# Lunch

One of my favourites is to go to the pie shop - you can get them hot, and the steak and cheese is just great!

Fish and Flounder have their own stall too (in addition to their shop further up the market) which is well worth checking out if you're a fish fan.

One of my favourite haunts is the Northfield Farm burger stall. I would contest it is one of the best burgers in London, absolutely delicious, and their meat (including bacon) is all from their farm. Great with an egg on top, and served with a smile too:

I actually had the vietnamese today, imperial barbequeue pork on rice noodles. They cook it in front of you, and then it's served with delicious salad and sauce. One of our ultimate favourites!

And the end result...

We went to eat ours down by the lock on the canal at the end of the market. Great to pass the time and watch people going about their day, to and from the market.

Of course, you can tell you're in Hackney...

That theme continues along the market, where you can buy (astonishingly expensive) vintage bikes right next to your artisan bread stall.

And this is probably my favourite shot of the day, I just caught it in the mirror as I walked past and managed to grab it. No visit to the market is complete without looking through the vintage clothes.
