There's not much that happens that gathers a group of F1 engineers around for a re-watch and an in-depth technical discussion.

However, the SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch (and more importantly the landing of the side rockets) was something that just did that.

The launch itself was pretty impressive - 27 engines working in concert made for a great launch. The car was a fun gimmic. But landing two side boosters next to each other within a second of each other? Pretty impressive!

Even if the main booster did run out of fuel and miss the landing, the whole process was a spectactular achievement and well worth another re-watch!
