This weekend Eddie had a wonderful little time. First of all, it snowed on Sunday morning so he was very happy about that:

It was still snowing while we were out!

We then took him for a shower at the pet shop, which he enjoyed - slightly more because he saw the rabbits in the shop!

Then he got some cheese when he got home, and promptedly refused to leave me alone for a long time!
