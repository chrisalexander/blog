I have recently written about my attempt to improve my happiness by reducing the amount of Twitter and online news I am reading.

In order to try and enforce this a little bit - or at least to break my habits - I have installed [AppDetox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dfki.appdetox&hl=en_GB) on my phone.

The setup I have gone for initially is a comination of a number of their blocking modes:

- By time: Twitter, BBC, NYT, and loads of other apps are blocked from 8am to 6pm
- By launch count: Outside these times, I can only open BBC, NYT and other reading apps 5 times per day
- By time: Outside these times, Twitter is restricted to 10 minutes per day

These seem quite aggressive so I might end up tweaking them, or going cold turkey first time might just do it!

The way this is enforced is really interesting, in that if you launch an app when you aren't meant to, it is just closed and you get a popup telling you off!

Fortunately, for "urgent" (or craving) scenarios, it is possible to override the rules for a bit if you do need to use it for a particular reason. I'm looking forward to seeing how it works out though!
