Been sorting though a few photos, and came across these I snapped at the recent CouchDB workshop held in association with #DevTank at LastMinute.com recently.

The workshop was really interesting, and while I haven't had much more of a chance to play with Couch since then, I would really like to when I get the opportunity.
