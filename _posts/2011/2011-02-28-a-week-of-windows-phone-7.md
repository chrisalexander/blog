A few weeks ago now I got hold of a shiny new HTC Trophy running Windows Phone 7.

I'm a bit of a smartphone geek (I'm permanently attached to my Nexus One) so to give the new platform on the block a bit of a workout, I thought I'd swap the Trophy for my usual N1 for a week to see how I got on with it.

I'm going to be publishing blog posts (check the [WP7 tag](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/tag/wp7)), [tweets](http://twitter.com/chris_alexander) and videos all week telling how I get on with it. This is day 1, and the first video is embedded below!
