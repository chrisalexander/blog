I've had a bit of a renovation.

I thought it was high time I changed my profile picture, as it was nearly two years old (it was taken on Christmas Day 2009). You can see it on Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, or hitting the "Profile" link above.

I also intended to have a bit of an overhaul of my CV. In the end, I decided to move all the important information over to LinkedIn, and then delete it. My old CV website (http://cv.chris-alexander.co.uk) now just redirects to LinkedIn, as the "Online CV" stuff does too.

If someone wants to hire me and complains that I don't have a traditional CV then I think I probably wouldn't want to be hired by them anyway; think of it as a pre-filter.
