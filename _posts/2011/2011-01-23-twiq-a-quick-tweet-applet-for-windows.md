It is with great pleasure that I announce my latest open-source adventure in the form of [Twiq](https://github.com/Kodhus/Twiq).

Twiq is a little applet for Windows that allows you to quickly tweet a message you come up with and then get straight back to work.

Too many times I have forgotten something funny, useful or generally tweetable while I wait for a web browser and Twitter.com or a client to load. No longer! Twiq is always listening just a keypress away (Ctrl+Win+Space in fact) to get that tweet dispatched efficiently.

You can't read tweets with Twiq, but then you'd get distracted from whatever you're working on. The flow for creating a tweet with Twiq has been designed to be super-smooth. Ctrl+Win+Space brings up the program, and puts your cursor in the tweet box; 140 taps gets you a witty, thoughtful, or useful tweet; press Return and your tweet is dispatched; Ctrl+Win+Space gets rid of Twiq and you back to work.

By popular demand - a screenshot of Twiq in action:

Twiq is free and open-source. The code is on [Github](https://github.com/Kodhus/Twiq), and you can get the [latest installer](https://github.com/downloads/Kodhus/Twiq/Installer.msi) from there too.
