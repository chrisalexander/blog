If you were at this month's Reading Geek Night you would have seen an excellent presentation by James Anderson of the University of Reading on the subject of "transreal arithmetic". This gives rise to the ability for computers to divide by zero.

James mentioned that he has another talk coming up on the subject, and the details are here:

**Date:** 27th January 2011 (Thursday)

**Location: **Palmer Building, University of Reading

**Time:** 7pm for a 7.30pm start

Full details and blurb [on the IET site](https://web.archive.org/web/20101214171953/http://www.theiet.org/local/uk/thames/berks/ec3270111.cfm).

There will probably be drinks and light nibbles beforehand so worth turning up for a nice chat at 7. This event is organised by the IET, and is free to attend and you don't need to register.

For those who may not find themselves at the University all that often, [I have created this helpful Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.441169,-0.943982&amp;spn=0.002531,0.005563&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;iwloc=000499d583d6487138abe&amp;msid=202313678230269951806.000499d580403f29b67cc) with a pin that shows you exactly which door you need to find on the campus. If you have an Android phone you can hit this map up on there too, to help guide you as you arrive :)

In the mean time, look forward to seeing the Geek Night crowd there.
