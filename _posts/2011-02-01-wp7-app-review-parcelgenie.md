After the product is chosen, you may customise the message sent to the recipient, then pay with either a credit or debit card, PayPal, or reverse charge SMS (which costs around 25% more). While the reverse charge SMS is definitely easier to set up (typing in a full credit card number and details isn't quick on the phone), the PayPal option is quick and doesn't cost any extra.

All in all a very easy to use app with a great experience which makes it dead easy to buy items and send them to your friends or loved ones - highly recommended for that unique and unexpected little gift.
