Google Currents has been available in the UK for a while now, and as Google is closing down Reader, I thought I'd give what will most likely be its "replacement" a go.

I must confess I've quite enjoyed reading with it. It doesn't have much of the content I'm used to, but it is still pretty interesting. Additionally, the widget is pretty nice to scroll through.

I also picked up a long-dead project where I was creating a Current for my blog. I've made some tweaks, improved the content, added Google+ posts and it's looking good.

If you'd like to subscribe (please give it a go!) you can do so [by clicking on this link](http://www.google.com/producer/editions/CAow45rgAQ/on_engineering) with any device that has Currents installed. This post should be appearing there soon.**<br> **
