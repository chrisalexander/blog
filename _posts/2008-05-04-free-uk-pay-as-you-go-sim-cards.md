If you're looking for a new Pay as you Go sim card for any of the major networks in the UK, sometimes you have to pay for them to be delivered - here are some links to get them sent out to you for free!

[O2](http://freesimo2.o2.co.uk/) - [Orange](http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/freesimcard) - [Tesco](http://www.tm-standardplus.co.uk/) - [T-Mobile](http://www.t-mobilesimgiveaway.co.uk/) - [Virgin](http://www.virginmobile.co.uk/promo/duoSim.html)

If you text a lot, I highly recommend the Orange Dolphin package - top up Â£10 and get 300 free texts to use in the next 30 days; top up more, and you get even more free texts! You get to keep your credit too :D
