We were extremely fortunate to be given a Nespresso coffee machine as a gift for our wedding (#5577) earlier in the week. 

I have never seen so much documentation for a machine with only 4 buttons - although most of it was rabbiting on about their endless coffee blends rather than operating instructions, which were nonetheless extensive.

However, as they say, the proof is in the pudding. Making a coffee is reasonably simple (even if the cleaning regime is not so much).

However the results for all of the various colours of capsules that I've tried so far have been very tasty. Even my wife (haha) who doesn't really like coffee ended up mostly finishing one off before I got to have a taste of it, so that can only be good.
