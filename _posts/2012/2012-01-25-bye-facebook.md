I just "deactivated" my Facebook account. Note they don't call it deletion - that would imply your data is actually gone - but at least it's better than nothing.

I'm fed up of their repeated screwups with privacy. Their apparent complete lack of regard for what anyone cares to be done with their data (I guess that's easy to do when you're making a lot of money out of it).

I only every used it for putting some photos on contacts on my phone, I'm not going to miss that particularly. In Android 4 you couldn't do that anyway, as Google blocked it.

The new Timeline thing was the final straw for me. Thanks, I really wanted to dredge up those status updates from 2007 with no way to delete them. 2012 me is not even close to 2007 me (I probably wouldn't recognise 2007 me in the street) and I don't really want to be reminded of that.

I guess it comes down to the fact that I really just don't give a crap about any of the information or benefits Facebook could offer me.
