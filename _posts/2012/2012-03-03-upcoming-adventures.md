Next week I'm going to be in the US for 8 days. I thought I'd post the rough schedule here so if anyone I know happens to be around, it would be great to meet up!

I'm going with UKTI as part of our prize for winning the SVC2UK competition a few months back.

We fly to SF on Monday, landing late Monday afternoon Pacific time. We're out and about in SF on Tuesday and Wednesday, Palo Alto on Thursday, then an early morning flight to Denver on to Austin on Friday morning for SXSW Interactive from Friday to Monday morning. We're heading back to the UK on Monday afternoon, landing Tuesday morning (very tired, presumably!).

Would be great to catch up with any SF pals while we're around (although not certain how long we will have as the schedule looks pretty stuffed) then of course anybody at SXSW. Can't wait!
