This is bit different from the usual programming, I'm not making any guarantees about content going forwards!

At the risk of sounding like a fourteen year old girl, [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20120224035536/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/taylor-swift-the-single-life) is a great interview with Taylor Swift.

(I fully realise not only do I discuss Taylor Swift in that previous sentence, but also link to a Vogue article. If this concerns you, please do not read on. I also posted this entry on my blog. That's fine, as I figure nobody reads it anyway.)

I like Taylor Swift's music. It has taken a while for me to admit to this (again, at risk of sounding like a fourteen year old girl) but it's a great blend of country and pop that I work really well to.

Not only that, but it turns out the woman behind it is completely normal. Despite selling out an 80-city year-long global stadium tour; awards and red carpets left right and center; being worth more zeros than I can write down; dating a list of people I've never heard of (they must be famous); hanging out with fashion designers, and being described as a "perfect model" size. And she's the same age as me.

Now that's a great way to make yourself feel that you haven't really accomplished that much in life!

I'd also say she's a great female role model for teenagers - how to handle fame, fortune, and one hell of a life without scandal or disaster.
