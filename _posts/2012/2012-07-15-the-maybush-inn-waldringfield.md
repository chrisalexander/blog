Last night we ended up out for dinner at the Maybush Inn in Waldringfield. Despite being in the middle of nowhere, it seems constantly packed, possibly because the food is absolutely delicious.

After we had a bit of a meander along the Deven which was nice seeing as the weather was good after a day of rain.
