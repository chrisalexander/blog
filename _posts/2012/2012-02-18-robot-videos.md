My [post earlier](/on-engineering/robots/nano-quadrotors-at-the-university-of-pennsylvania/) about the hovering robots got me thinking about other robot videos I've seen recently. I thought I'd have a look to see what else is around online at the moment. Here are some highlights.

### Big Dog

This video has been around for quite some time but its rather impressive. Highly tuned reactive control system in action, and very nicely done too.

### Aldebaran Nao

Spotted these little guys' new version announcement a few months back. Seem a bit gimmicky in the promo video but I wouldn't say no to having a go with one. Would be interested in finding out how its programmed, unfortunately they're very secretive with their APIs.

### Asimo

Honda's got a bit gimmicky with Asimo too.
