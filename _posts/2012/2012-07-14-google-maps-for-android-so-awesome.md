I must admit I fail to see why Apple would decide to move to its own maps given just how incredible Google Maps has become recently. 

After some very nice upgrades, the maps in London on Android have become just incredible - even better than using Google Maps in a desktop browser. 

Now it has 3D buildings, internal layouts for train stations, improved rendering in navigation and so much more. It is a really invaluable tool and just blows everything else out of the water.
