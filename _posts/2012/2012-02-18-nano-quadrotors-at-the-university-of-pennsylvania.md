Here are some really awesome robots in action. The University of Pennsylvania's GRASP lab has been working on getting quadrotors under control and working together in tasks.

It looks like these are controlled by a central computer wirelessly and then tracked with cameras and markers in the environment, which is a great way to quickly get started without requiring gigantic machines with processing and swarm communication algorithms on board.

The first video has been doing the rounds online, but the other two are still really worth checking out.
