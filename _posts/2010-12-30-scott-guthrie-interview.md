The videos from PDC, Microsoft's Professional Developers Conference back in October are now online. Channel 9 were live at the event, and had some extremely interesting interviews in the "backchannel" for the conference.

They spoke to Scott Guthrie, head of the developer division at Microsoft, who covers all kinds of topics including how to get started developing with Windows Phone 7, and some great demos of Windows Phone 7 apps to inspire developers looking to work with Windows Phone 7.

Check out the video below for the full interview and demos.
