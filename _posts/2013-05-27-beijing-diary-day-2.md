Today was all about wedding planners.

The highlights of the day, however, were food related.

Lunch was at xiabu xiabu, a Chinese fast food chain where you cook your own food in hot pots. Tasty!

I did learn how to write Coca-Cola in Chinese. Its all in the squares.

For dinner we went for Beijing duck. This time we went to the more touristy place, but next time I'm hoping to go to the local place in the business district - much better atmosphere. But the duck was still delicious.
