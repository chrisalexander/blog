Ever since we got Eddie a few months ago we have been trying to keep an eye on him while we're out to make sure he's not too lonely and upset on his own (he is a rescue dog after all).

A few people have seen me watch EddieCam since we got it, so here are the details for it.

The camera we got is from Amazon, pretty cheap at around Â£35 (especially compared to the others you can get, in the hundreds!) - and seems to be working pretty great so far.

[Here's the link to it](http://fave.co/2k5ATeU).

There are some really good features of the camera, such as:

- Simple set-up (make sure you change the passwords!)
- Wide range of pan and tilt
- Great quality
- No monthly fee (peer-to-peer connection)
- Works when you're home and out
- Configurable audio / motion alarms (alerts on Android app only)
- Night vision

Here you can see it in action on my phone, over 4G - decent quality and it looks like Eddie's having plenty of fun with his toys!
