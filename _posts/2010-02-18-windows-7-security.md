So now that Windows 7 has been out and about a bit in the wild, security firms that previously made millions from selling their wares to naive users are finding their revenues dropping.

That is the only reason, I can guess, for them to be going to the harsh marketing that they have been up to recently. It basically amounted to them saying that Windows 7 was insufficiently secure and you "needed" another level of protection.

Of course, any extra protection is recommended; but in this case I think there is something that can outdo AVG and their irresponsible advertising campaign.

[Microsoft Security Essentials](http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/) is a virus and malware scanner from Microsoft, built to work seamlessly with Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7.

It's a comprehensive package that's available totally free and with no nagging advertising to users of genuine versions of Windows. You can download it today from the [Security Essentials site](http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/), and there are some screenshots posted below.
