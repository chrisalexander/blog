ITV haven't had a very good few days.

Error after catastrophic error have caused them a substantial PR disaster, with Twitter users lamenting (at least when Twitter was up) about the poor service being provided.

Here's why I think ITV should left to wither and important broadcasts given to the BBC.

## England game advert breaks

I acknowledge that ITV is a commercial company and needs to make money. But none the less, the advertising leading up to the England - USA game was outrageous even for them.

So much so, that they managed to fit an advertising break *between* the National Anthems and the kickoff. Quite how they managed that I'm not sure, but they only had seconds to spare - about 2 between the end of the ad break and the first kick of the ball.

I realise this was probably worth a few million quid to them, but none the less - the user experience was a shocker.

## HD channel ultimate screwup

This one's pretty much unforgivable.

England scored after 3.5 minutes, of course, and during that time the ITV HD channel managed to show an advert. Just a single advert, then a black screen, but before it started it was 0-0 and they came back to Steven Gerrard celebrating his goal. Pretty shocking.

## Online feed sucks

This is the subject of my rants from Saturday on Twitter.

ITV and the BBC share the TV broadcasts of the World Cup - basically alternating games with exceptions for England ones. So I wanted to check out one of the other games on the ITV website, and it didn't end well at all.

First of all, I got served 3 video ads before the live stream started. Then, the live stream failed to start, so I reloaded the page - and got a load more adverts. This time the video feed did at least start - but the quality was so poor, I couldn't see the ball 95% of the time, and at one point the goalkeeper for one team disappeared entirely. So I gave up and switched over to TV Catchup to watch the ITV1 feed streamed in significantly better quality.

## Points all feedback to Twitter - then don't engage

I undertook my rant against the @itvinsider Twitter account, which their @ITV (completely unused) Twitter account points everyone to. Which isn't that much use, because despite my somewhat public tirade of their atrocious service, I'm yet to hear anything back.

I guess I'll continue extolling the virtues of the BBC until they can sort themselves out.
