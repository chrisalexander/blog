The latest version of Microsoft's IDE for development on Windows and other Microsoft platforms has recently been released, which is Visual Studio 2010.

You may have seen my post some time ago about the [long list of new features](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/3112) and improvements that have made it into the latest version.

At the recent UK Tech Days event, Microsoft's GM for Visual Studio gave a presentation on building great Windows 7 apps with Visual Studio. He made lots of good points, and mentioned lots of cool features. Well worth checking out the video, which I have embedded below.
