I've noticed an upsurge recently in the number of news articles talking about spam e-mails and the such: it seemed that it was really big a few years ago but the issue disappeared. What makes me wonder why it's cropped up again is that I don't actually get any.

That's not technically accurate. I got 2324 spam e-mails in the last month. But that doesn't mean I don't have to look at them - I didn't see a single one. Thanks to Google Mail's advanced filtering technologies, they all get sifted into my spam folder where I never have to look at them, and they disappear all by themselves when their 30 days are up. Nice :)
