When we were working on [An Advent of Carols](https://chris-alexander.co.uk/on-engineering/music/advent-of-carols/), I read up a bit about Coventry Carol and found it had some additional music to go with it.

I had a go at transcribing it into something a bit more modern (mensural notation is not the easiest thing in the world to read) and we recorded it on some modern brass instruments.

So we have the existing Coventry Carol in the middle, with some slightly weird harmonies and bar lengths to match the original notation, plus two new pieces I had never heard before.

Take a listen and read a bit more here: [The Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors](https://coventry-carol.chris-alexander.co.uk/).
