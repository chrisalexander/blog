Wenni and I have been working hard through December to create a recording of some Christmas carols.

We bought ourselves a new Digital Audio Workstation (to avoid having to use the computer) and after we had done a couple, we just kept going until we had 22. Then we decided to chuck in a few more to round it up to an entire advent's worth!

Please go to our dedicated site to enjoy them: [An Advent of Carols](https://an-advent-of-carols.wenni.co.uk/).
