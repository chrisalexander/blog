Recently I've been getting into the Podcasts on my iPod when I make my way to work in the morning and when I need to chill out a bit at home. Usually they're informative and entertaining, but yesterday I watched this talk by Ken Robinson entitled "Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity".

The title is immediately caught my attention, as such a striking statement against the education that has (or seems to, at least) done me well so far.

Here's the video to check out before I go into what I think of what he says.
