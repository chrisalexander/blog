I have written and talked in the past on the subject of hacking Kinect, and how awesome it would be to hook it up to our robot project at Uni. Well I'm pleased to say that last week we achieved robot arm control with the Kinect sensor, using it to measure arm position and relay it to the arm, which then moved to mirror the action.

Check out the videos below (instructional and cheesy each in their own way) for demos of the Kinect and arm doing its thing.

Credits go to Stefan, Jean-Jacques and Ioannis (my fellow team members), and our supervisor Prof. Harwin for letting us play around with this stuff. If you want the code, it's all free on Github [here](http://github.com/chrisalexander/libfreenect) and [here](http://github.com/chrisalexander/spine).
