Google have started posting a series of videos aimed at explaining AI and Machine Learning to people without a background in these topics.

They are using every day terms that many people will understand, and also examples that are relevant to most people's experience, making this a very good series if you are interested in AI and ML but don't know where to start with it.

I've embedded the playlist below, and you can [watch it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ476O86hbU&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK6HyKuHTRDCMxkOPFB2vfp) too.
