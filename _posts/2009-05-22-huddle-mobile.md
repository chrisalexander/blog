As some of you may know, last summer I had a placement at a (what was then small) software startup called [Huddle](http://www.huddle.net). While I was there, I was doing a lot of work on their API - automating the testing procedures, building example apps and so on.

On Wednesday I found myself requiring the use of Huddle's workspaces while I was in University. All I had available to me was my iPod touch and my mobile.Unfortunately, many features of Huddle.net are unavailable to mobile users, due to their requirements on rich text editors like that I am using to compose this post. So, I decided to do something about it, and over the course of the subsequent 24 hours I wrote a mobile version of the site using their API.

24 hours later, I've been and demoed it in their office, registered a domain name and launched it for the world. The Huddle devs are taking on board my feedback on what they could improve on the API (some requests return rather unexpected/inconsistent status codes for example) and their UI team is helping with a bit of a visual overhaul.

Check out the site at [Clustr.me.uk](http://clustr.me.uk) (if you visit on a desktop you'll get a nice presentation page - visit on iPhone/iPod to get the optimised version, and any other mobile phone to get the standard Clustr)
