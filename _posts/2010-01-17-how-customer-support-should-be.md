Last weekend there was a post on TechCrunch about a US company that had just opened up out of private beta which was offering a service that automatically monetises outbound links on your website by passing them through referral URLs.

I recognised the business model from [Skimlinks](http://www.skimlinks.com), a company I came across while I was at [Huddle](http://www.huddle.net) in 2008.

## Signing Up

Since my blog has been growing, I thought I would be able to apply and stand a good chance of being approved.

I filled in the [signup form](http://skimlinks.com/register) carefully and as accurately as I could, and was pleased to see that it would take them at most 3 days to get back to me.

This morning, over a week later, I still hadn't got a response, so [tweeted](http://twitter.com/chris_alexander/status/7861544815):

Applied to @skimlinks over a week ago and nothing yet - 3 days?! Saw competitor on TC and thought I'd go for the UK guys. So much for that.
