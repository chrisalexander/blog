Last weekend there was a post on TechCrunch about a US company that had just opened up out of private beta which was offering a service that automatically monetises outbound links on your website by passing them through referral URLs.

I recognised the business model from [Skimlinks](http://www.skimlinks.com), a company I came across while I was at [Huddle](http://www.huddle.net) in 2008.
