There's been some uproar (somewhat undeservedly, in my opinion at least) over the new trending alerts bar thingy that turned up in Twitter for iPhone with its last update. So much so that [some clever person](http://twitter.com/#!/gruber/status/43893169724723200) decided to tag it the #dickbar - which promptly became a trending topic for a number of days.

Looks like Twitter do have a sense of humour about all of this though - check out the #dickbar that Twitter constructed in their office:

They've since [modified the bar](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/08/twitter-responds-to-backlash-dickbar-no-longer-covers-tweets/) - if you update your app you should see the new behaviour.

Thanks to Twitter's @manuel for the picture and @isaach for the heads-up.
