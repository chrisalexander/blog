The other day I got delivered a rather nice [Flip Ultra HD](https://web.archive.org/web/20090110175926/http://www.theflip.com/products_flip_ultra.shtml#scene=sceneUltraHD) from Microsoft to do some video work for them. Very nice piece of kit! Before I got to have a play I thought it would be worth an unboxing and a bit of a demo.

Overall the device is absurdly simple to use. I never thought you could get a digital camera with less than 10 buttons, let alone a 720p HD video camera (the Flip has 9 buttons, and that is including the flicker to open the USB port!!).

The specifications are impressive too; rechargeable batteries that go for 2.5 hours, 8 gigabytes of internal storage for 2 hours of HD video, build in mini-HDMI out, a truly fantastic screen, and all in one simple to use and compact package.

I don't mean to keep going on about it, but this thing is absolutely superb!

I'm definitely looking forward to shooting some video with this, so if you see me around waving this, then be sure to give me a wave!<br>
