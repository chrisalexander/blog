It seems that recent Monday events such as #MoreCheeseMonday and #MicrosoftMonday (ok maybe that one was just me and @AlexForrow) have gone a bit quiet recently, so in an attempt to revive them, may I introduce this particularly large volume of cheese I acquired yesterday.

Unlike my previous #MoreCheeseMonday blog post, this time I am actually referring to cheese (the last one was my [abstract taste in music](/215)), and my favourite "Seriously Strong" cheddar at that. When I found these at better than half the price I usually pay, I snapped up quite a few.

On the #MicrosoftMonday front, I'm pleased to report that I'm wearing a UK 2008 Imagine Cup t-shirt.

Hopefully I'll have a chance to write a few more posts tonight and soon normal blogging will be restored.
