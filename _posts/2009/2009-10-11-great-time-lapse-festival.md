I was surfing the net today and came across this decidedly *awesome* time-lapse video of a festival.

I had to go on a bit of a dig to find out what it was on about and who did it, and it turns out it was directed by [Ray Klein](http://www.rayklein.com/), and taken at the [Coachella Music and Arts Festival](http://www.coachella.com/). Check out some more info on it over on [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/09/30/bb-video-coachella-t.html), or just sit back and enjoy below...
