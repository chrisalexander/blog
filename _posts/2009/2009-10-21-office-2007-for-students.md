Office 2007 is the latest release of Microsoft's flagship office productivity suite. But inside the huge feature set (including all the new stuff), how exactly can it help you get the best out of your studies?

I've taken a look at the whole suite of applications, and come up with a list of features that are remarkably useful for students to get stuff done faster.

What's even better is you can get Office 2007 for only £40 from The Ultimate Steal!

## New Navigation: the Ribbon

The primary applications in Office 2007 (Word, PowerPoint, Excel etc.) have a new method of navigating among the multitude of settings, and its called the Ribbon.

Many people have said to me that this may be all well and good, but it is difficult to use. Initially the Ribbon can take a lot of getting used to, and finding settings you just know exist but not quite where, but once you're used to it the Ribbon makes navigating to the features you want quick and simple, and a lot less stressful than the old menu!

## Word's new Equation Editor

If you're on any kind of Mathematics, Engineering or Computer Science degree, inserting equations into documents is a daily necessity. Previously, plugins were the best way of doing this. But with Word 2007, inserting complex equations into your document is simple. Inserting a new equation is as simple as selecting the Insert tab, then the Equation button (in the Symbols box on the far right). Then the Equation Tool Design contextual tab will appear, giving you a whole range of options to quickly and simply enter your equation. You can even type in equations using parenthesis, symbols and more, and it will convert it to the formatted version for you automatically.

## Bibliographies: Now made simple!

I don't know about you, but I always found Bibliographies / lists of references / citations easily the most tedious and error-prone parts of writing a document for University - especially late the night before deadline day!!

Word makes it simple to add references as you go, and automatically update all locations of them in one go - finally!

## Export as PDF

It doesn't come with support installed, but at last you can export your Office 2007 documents as PDFs. You can download the plugin from [Microsoft's website](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=4D951911-3E7E-4AE6-B059-A2E79ED87041&amp;displaylang=en).

## Page Layout view in Excel 2007

New in Excel 2007, you can now view your Excel spreadsheets how they will appear when they are printed with the Page Layout View. So how is this different to Print Preview? Well you can actually edit the data while in this view, which is really useful if you're managing charts you're about to print. The option is available in the View tab, second button on the left.

## Your PowerPoint looks great!

PowerPoint 2007 comes with some excellent Themes for your presentations, so you can make yours stand out from the rest with a single click in the Ribbon. It is also incredibly easy to edit the themes, which then update all of the slides in your current deck. If you hover your mouse over a theme in the Ribbon, it also gives you a Live Preview on your slides so you can check it out before you decide to change. You can find the themes in the Design tab of PowerPoint 2007.
