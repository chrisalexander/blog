A few months ago I was asked to do a presentation at the University of Reading for students about to go into their final year of their IT degrees. The subject of the presentation was how Microsoft tools and technology could help them complete their aims of their final year projects.

I put together a presentation, and as part of that I also put together a practical which I encouraged the attendees to complete to give them a sample of what they could do with Visual Studio on Windows and Silverlight.

If you're interested in Windows development but don't know where to start, or you'd like to get stuck into Visual Studio but need a few pointers, I have attached the file below for you to download and have a go.

Let me know any feedback and how you get on in the comments!
