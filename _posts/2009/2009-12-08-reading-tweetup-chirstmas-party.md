It's that time of year again!

Christmas is upon us and we are holding a Christmas Tweetup! It will be at 8pm on Tuesday the 22nd of December at Giraffe.

The cost is approximately £15.95 (for 2 courses) or £19.95 (for 3 courses) - we are looking to get a discount so hopefully it will be a bit cheaper.

Giraffe offers a modern twist on the traditional Christmas menu, giving us a great range to choose from - you can view the Christmas menu [here](http://giraffe.net/assets/giraffe/downloads/christmas_menu.pdf).

If you are interested in coming please leave a comment below or [on the original post](http://rdgtweetup.co.uk/2009/12/christmas-party-2009/) with your Twitter details by **13:00 on 9th of December**.

Each booking has to have a £10.00 deposit, payable by the end of the Reading Tweetup on the 9th of December. There are 2 payment methods:

* BACS Payment, we will DM you the rdgtweetup bank account details
* Cash on the 9th of December

We hope you can all make it! It's shaping up to be a great event, a lot of fun, and a chance to celebrate Christmas with the fellow tweeters of Reading.
