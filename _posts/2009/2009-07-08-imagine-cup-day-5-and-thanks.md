Well what a day today has been...

It started off pretty slowly - a nice long lie-in for the first time since we've been here. I didn't mean to, but I rolled over, turned my alarm off, and then went back to sleep for 2 hours (I must have needed it).This evening was most definitely the highlight of the trip - the World Festival (where they announced all the prize winners), hosted on a purpose-built stage in the shadow of the pyramids. Pretty epic setup all round, really! Well done to the UK teams who were still in the running, the games dev team came home with an excellent third, and the short film guys actually won it! They'll be getting Paramount's worldwide distribution network on which to share the film they made, so that is pretty cool for them (hopefully pics will follow soon).

Tomorrow is our last day in Egypt - we're going to check out and visit the Cairo museum in the morning, then head off to the airport for the flight home.

Thanks so much to all of the Microsoft and Egyptian team out here - there are so so many to mention, but I will make sure a few get in; everyone responsible for organising the trips, hotels, bookings, and all that general admin stuff that made the whole thing possible; the Microsoft UK guys, Paolo Ed and Andy - legends! We mustn't forget the competitors, who were such fun to be around despite the high stress for the first few days and who did their country proud; and finally to the Egyptians who made our stay so comfortable and welcoming, especially Evronia, Nada and the rest of the Egyptian MSPs who bailed me out on more than one occasion and were great fun to be with! Hopefully see you all soon.
