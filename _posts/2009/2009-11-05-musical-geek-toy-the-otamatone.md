And now for something a little different.

The [Otamatone](http://www.otamatone.co.uk) is branded as a "quirky musical instrument" - and it most definitely fits that description. It is some kind of mashup of a normal musical instrument, a Japanese toy (and we know how crazy [they can be](http://incrediblethings.com/lists/14-bizarre-japanese-toys/)), and a [theremin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin), producing a resulting tone that can only be described as "wailing".

The video below of three Otamatones in action just has to be seen heard to be believed - if you like their style (or are getting jealous of your hungry cat) then [head over to Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OTAUH8) to pick yourself one up before Christmas.
