Thanks to @marcholmes for sending me a couple of pages of [Expression Blend 3](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/try-it) Sketchflow magnets.

Sketchflow is a new way of visualising user interfaces in Expression Blend, making it incredibly simple for designers to focus on the user experience without having to worry about the look. Not only that but the Sketchflow controls can be very quickly switched to normal .net controls for developers to have a play with.

Look out for my upcoming events for a chance to get your hands on one of these packs of magnets!
