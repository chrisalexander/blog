We've already talked about the opportunities (#1209) availalable at the various Imagine Cup competitions (#1210) (if you missed it, catch up in the Imagine Cup category). Now it's time to take a look at what you could win by taking part.

{% include images/block.html src="http://media.chris-alexander.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/ic10.PNG" %}It's not as if the [opportunities](../1209) weren't enough for you just by taking part, here are some extra prizes that should help you along the way.

If your team wins the worldwide [Software Design competition](http://imaginecup.com/Competition/mycompetitionportal.aspx?competitionId=37), not only will you get the trip to Poland where you would have completed, but you will also get $25,000 to share among your team. On top of this, there's the global exposure, the chance for industry to pick up you and your ideas, and a great opportunity to meet people from around the world.

But you don't have to get that far to reap the benefits - win the UK heats, and you will get awards at a ceremony before you fly out to Poland, and exposure around the UK to highlight your winning entry. You will also have made a great difference to the charities that your software was aiming to help.

So what are you waiting for?! Get started on the [Imagine Cup website today](http://imaginecup.com/Competition/mycompetitionportal.aspx?competitionId=37).
