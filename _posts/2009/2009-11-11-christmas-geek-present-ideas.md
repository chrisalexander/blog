So Christmas and the winter holiday season is nearly upon us - so you will all soon be looking out for what you can get your friends and family to celebrate.

I always have problems finding cool presents for my friends - they're very much into technology and finding them something suitable and that I can afford is always tricky!

Fortunately there are some great value deals to be had at the moment that would make great presents, and won't break the bank!!

First of all, if you're a student, you can get Windows 7 at fantastically reasonable prices - ideal for family members who you can join in the fun with. If you're in the US you can get it on [this site](http://www.win741.com/), otherwise you can get it [from here](http://www.ultimatesteal.co.uk/student71) for the UK. Read about all the [benefits of Windows 7 here](/930).

What about some new hardware for Christmas? You can find an excellent range of student deals on the Microsoft website, for getting your hands on the latest [BlueTrack mice](/645) can be dead easy and great value. Why not check out [Microsoft Hardware](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/) and the Student deals today?

Of course, if you have any suggestions for other great presents, just drop a comment and I'll be happy to add them in!
