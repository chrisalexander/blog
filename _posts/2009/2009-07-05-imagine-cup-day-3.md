This one is going to be short and sweet, as I spent most of the day in bed feeling rather unwell unfortunately.

Our games team did their final presentation this morning, and I hear it went really well. By the time that was over, everyone was finished and we hit the pool for a few hours! Dinner was an interesting and seemingly egyptian concoction, but I needed to eat. None the less some of it was quite tasty.

Today I managed to take no photos or video, hopefully that will be rectified with a visit to the pyramids tomorrow.
