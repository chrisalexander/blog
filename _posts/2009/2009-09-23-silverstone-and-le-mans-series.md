A couple of weeks ago I was incredibly lucky to be invited to Silverstone to watch the final event of the Le Mans Series with a pit lane pass and access to the British Racing Drivers Club. Not bad eh?

Well it got even better - I was picked up in nothing less than a Ferrari F360 Spider, something that needed to be [TwitPic'd to be believed](http://twitpic.com/hkdtx)!

So that was a pretty awesome experience. For me it was also a fantastic opportunity to see what it was actually like at Silverstone - I'd seen it many times on the TV with the British Grand Prix being held there for many years (and long may it continue to do so) but to get in to the pit lane just metres from the cars while they are firing up their engines ready to head to the grid is very cool indeed.

I also enjoyed the British Racing Drivers Club - generally a very pleasant place to be and to sit and watch the cars race around the last three corners through the floor-to-ceiling wall-to-wall windows. Of course the F1 was also on the big screens live from Monza which was an added bonus!

Here are a few shots from the pit lane and during the race; I hope they convey a bit of the atmosphere of the day.
