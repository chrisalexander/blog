You may remember that a little while ago I released a little solution I had put together called Clustr - it was for accessing Huddle.net services from your mobile device (iPhone, iPod Touch, Blackberries, Smartphones etc.) while you're on the go.

The launch went really well, and everyone seemed very happy with the product.

I'm now pleased to announce that the largest lingering issue from my very rapid development of the product has been cleared up - File Downloads are now reliable and stable! A few hours of tinkering with both the Huddle API and the PHP that powers the site means everything works really well now.

So why not go check it out now? (You'll have to be on your iPhone / iPod Touch / Mobile Phone to see the actual product). As ever, please report any bugs to me at the links in the Contact tab above.
