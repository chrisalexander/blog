I've been doing a bit of work on my websites, and as well as getting a new 404 page for this domain, I have revamped http://cv.chris-alexander.co.uk.

The old design did the job but didn't really convey where I think I've improved in website design and execution recently, so hopefully the new version does my skills justice.

Please check it out and let me know what you think either in the comments or in the Connect tab at the top of this page.
