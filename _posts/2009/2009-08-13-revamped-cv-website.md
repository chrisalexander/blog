I've been doing a bit of work on my websites, and as well as getting a new 404 page for this domain, I have revamped [my CV page](http://cv.chris-alexander.co.uk).

The old design did the job but didn't really convey where I think I've improved in website design and execution recently, so hopefully the new version does my skills justice.

Please [check it out](http://cv.chris-alexander.co.uk) and let me know what you think either in the comments or in the Connect tab at the top of this page.
