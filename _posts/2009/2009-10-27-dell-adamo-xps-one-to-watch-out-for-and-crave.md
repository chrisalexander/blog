Its high time we had a blog post about some juicy hardware to drool over, and I don't really want to linger on the fruit company much longer, so time for some gorgeous Windows 7-powered pure awesomeness.

Now it's not often that I'll start a blog post with a sentence crammed of so may words of high praise for *anything*, let alone a piece of hardware I haven't even had my hands on yet. But I think you'll agree that this one is more than worth it - the [Dell Adamo XPS](https://web.archive.org/web/20100206053911/http://www.adamobydell.com/xps/us).

Thing of beauty, no?

Well Dell have been slow on the details for this super-slimline piece, [much](http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/09/dell-teases-new-ultrathin-adamo-xps/) [to](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/22/dell-adamo-xps-opens-up-for-windows-7-festivities-but-still-not/) [Engadget's](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/12/new-adamo-xps-image-takes-a-stand/)[ frustration](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/07/dell-announces-updated-adamo/).

I'm pleased to be able to report, however, that a video is now available for you to view below (apologies for the atrocious music) and drool over (at least that's what I did).

Looks like this is going to be very high on my wish list in the future, especially if it has a bit of clout to run Windows 7!

Thanks to @MarkJo and [Steve Clayton](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecla01/archive/2009/10/13/adamo-xps-new-photos.aspx) (@SteveCla) for the information on this.

*Edit:* Oops, looks like someone's had this taken down. Will get it restored ASAP
