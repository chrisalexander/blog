I'll keep this brief as I've been up since 4.30 this morning, and it's now 2.30 (local), and after a busy day of travelling etc. I'm just about ready to call it a day.

I guess any blog post about travelling would be nothing without a mention of the journey, which was painless other than a small hiccup at customs (which I won't go into) and the Cairo traffic (which I will).One of the first things you notice about Cairo is the different in living means, posessions, and general quality of life between the "have's" and the "have not's". This was something i was warned about, but could never be quite prepared for.

The first major event was at the Citadel in Cairo. This is a very impressive, "Parthenon"-like structure on the top of the highest point in Cairo. The venue was absolutely spectacular (pics to follow), the food excellent and the speakers good.

Tomorrow will be a busy day as all competition is starting, and I will be covering it with as much media etc. as I can! Hopefully now I have wifi all will be much easier.
