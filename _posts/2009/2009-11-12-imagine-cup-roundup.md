## Write Software. Change the World.

*Imagine a world where technology helps solve the toughest problems*

This is the bold calling of the 2010 [Imagine Cup](http://imaginecup.com/), Microsoft's worldwide student technology competition. Aimed at students just like you the whole world over, the aim of the Software Design competition is to give *you* the opportunity to revolutionise how technology enhances our lives.

The aims of the Software Design aspect of the Imagine Cup are massive - address the [UN Millennium Development Goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals) with software and technology. This includes addressing issues related to hunger relief; poverty; education; disease control; healthcare; the environment; and other challenges facing our world today.

## Highlights of Egypt 2009

Last year the Imagine Cup Worldwide Final was held in Cairo, Egypt. Over 5 days, there was intense competition, friendly conversation, fantastic innovation and a sensational atmosphere.

Unfortunately my entry did not make it through to the final stages, however I was lucky enough to go along to Egypt with the Microsoft UK team. Here are some of my highlights of the Imagine Cup 2009.

For me, Cairo was an absolutely sensational experience, and I enjoyed every second of it. When we weren't watching ground-breaking presentations by students from every corner of the world, we were meeting new, like-minded people, and experience the rich culture and heritage that Egypt has to offer.

What about the opportunities that you may get from taking part in the competition?

The simple fact of the matter is that taking part in this competition gives you more opportunities than from taking part in any other student activity that I have come across.
