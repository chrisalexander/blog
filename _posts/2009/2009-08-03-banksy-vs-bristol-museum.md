Last Saturday, a crew from Reading made the 2-hour excursion to central Bristol to visit the [Banksy ](http://www.banksy.co.uk/)vs Brisol Museum exhibition. It [promised to be](/on-engineering/life/announcing-the-rdgtweetup-great-expedition/) very good and we were all very excited about it!

Once we arrived there was the predictably long queue - almost exactly 2 hours of waiting in on-and-off drizzle, in fact.

There was a little Banksy entertainment to keep the waiting crowds occupied - on the final approach to the museum, this piece of work became apparent:

Once we were inside it was more than worth the wait! Banksy and his crew had pulled out all the stops to put on a brilliant show.

Opening the "Art of Banksy" section was an enclosed area featuring the tools that Banksy uses to complete his guerilla work - used stencils, paint, drawings and scribbled notes. This was one of my favourite pieces from the opening room; the painted line stretched all over the floor, walls and round the artwork.

The next area of the museum featured various animatronic creations, all of which were outstanding. From the old and frail Tweetie Pie, the "living" fish fingers, hotdogs and chicken nuggets, to this wonderful creation with CCTV cameras.

By far my favourite work, and the best-executed, in the animatronic section was this excellent artistic monkey. He was continually blinking and breathing, which when you first noticed it was very unnerving!

Banksy also had his way with a few bits and pieces in the rest of the museum. He had fun with a couple of pieces in the "expensive painting" bits:

And finally, he hid a few extras in the rest of the museum's cabinets...

All in all, everyone there had a great day. After we had finished at Banksy we went on a bit of an explore around Bristol, had some lunch, went "in" the Apple store, then paid a visit to Ikea on the way home.
