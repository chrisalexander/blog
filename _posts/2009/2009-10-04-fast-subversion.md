After months of struggling, hard toil, and generally getting pretty annoyed at Unfuddle, I've finally found the one and only way to get Subversion to run at a respectable and somewhat useful speed.

In other news, today I've installed and configured Subversion and Memcache and properly setup MySQL on the box labelled "Subversion Server" (it doesn't do *just* that), which I think is quite an achievement considering my practically non-existent sysadmin skills.
