*Imagine a world where technology helps solve the toughest problems*

This is the bold calling of the 2010 [Imagine Cup](http://imaginecup.com), Microsoft's worldwide student technology competition. Aimed at students just like you the whole world over, the aim of the Software Design competition is to give *you* the opportunity to revolutionise how technology enhances our lives.

## Big Goals. Huge Challenges.

The aims of the Software Design aspect of the Imagine Cup are massive - address the [UN Millennium Development Goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals) with software and technology. This includes addressing issues related to hunger relief; poverty; education; disease control; healthcare; the environment; and other challenges facing our world today.

## End Hunger. Cure Diseases. Bring Relief.

The UN Millennium Development Goals are wide-ranging and affect every corner of the world. All of them can be addressed with technology, and the Imagine Cup offers students the opportunity to prove this, and their own prowess, on a global stage.

### UN Millennium Development Goals

* Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
* Achieve universal primary education
* Promote gender equality and empower women
* Reduce child mortality
* Improve maternal health
* Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
* Ensure environmental stability
* Develop a global partnership for development

It's certainly a big challenge - possibly one of the biggest you'll be faced with as students. But it is incredibly rewarding too. Not only the sensational, unavailable-elsewhere prizes (more on those later this week), but the real knowledge that you will make a difference on a global scale.
