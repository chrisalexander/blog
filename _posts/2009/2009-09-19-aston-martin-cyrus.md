I was taking a look at the TweetMeme Aston Martin channel earlier and came across a car announced at the Frankfurt Motor Show that I'd previously missed.

The Aston Martin Cyrus is basically a DB9 or DBS equipped with a new body kit, consisting of a 100% carbon fibre body, and with even more on the inside. I don't think I've ever seen this much carbon fibre on a single car ever!

Pity about the choice of colour on the inside, I think I would rather have something slightly less bright. Pretty awesome none the less.
