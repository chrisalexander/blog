The Imagine Cup is the world's premier student technology competition - with unparalleled challenges, experiences, and prizes, if you do anything at all this year, you'll want to be part of this.

There is a whole series of posts coming up on the blog about what you can expect from the Imagine Cup this year. But in the mean time, check out my experiences from Imagine Cup 2009, which was in Egypt. Keep your eyes on the Imagine Cup category and the Imagine Cup tag for posts as they come in during the next few days.
