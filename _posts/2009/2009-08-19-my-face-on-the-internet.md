You may or may not have seen over the past few hours that my face has been somewhat plastered all over [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com) and [Mashable](http://mashable.com). Today Tweetmeme announced the soon-to-be-live commenting system for stories, and Nick used some of my test comments for the press shots. I guess this is a bit egotistical of me, but check out the shots of me on [TechCrunch.com](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/what-if-comments-could-be-retweeted-tweetmeme-is-working-on-it/), [Uk.TechCrunch.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090824023550/http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/retweetcom-launches-and-theyre-still-using-tweetmemes-code/), and [Mashable.com](http://mashable.com/2009/08/19/retweet-comments/)...
