I've just done a dump of all the photos I took at the Imagine Cup worldwide finals in Cairo.

<!-- Replace missing image from http://media.chris-alexander.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/2-12-blog-200x300.jpg -->

The pictures are available on my [Windows Live SkyDrive](http://cid-c16ba2a0210af2a8.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Imagine%20Cup%20Pics?authkey=G2xvpWtR5zg%24). Please let me have any feedback you have on them!
