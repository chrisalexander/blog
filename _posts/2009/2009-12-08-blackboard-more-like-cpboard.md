Blackboard is an academic tool, used by hundreds of educational establishments worldwide. It is a highly adaptable, extensible database back-end and web interface front-end.

On paper it is quite simply phenomenal, in practice however I suspect it's the worst â€˜web-app' designed by man. Hit the link to find out why.

Lets start with the basics; it often doesn't work. Below is a table of some major features supported by Blackboard, and if that feature has failed during my use of it:

Now excuse my presumption, but I think you'd have to agree the above table is a pretty good display, of fairly poor performance. If you happen to be a fairly (or even vaguely) web-ducated person, you'll notice that most of the above tasks are fairly simple to achieve. Hrm, a website that provides 24/7 services... yea, excuse me while I remain *not* blown away.

A second gripe of mine is the interface in general. To the web-savvy amongst you, I can be succinct; Blackboard uses frames. To the non web-savvy, I can still be fairly succinct; Blackboard employs a layout technique that good websites did away with 10 years or more ago.

Navigating a Blackboard page is tortuous, Blackboard offers customisation options that can make a static page look like crap. And where my mind boggles, is that some poor coder had to provide this extensibility. I'd rather the file upload utility worked *before* you start giving me the option to make all buttons bright orange!

My third and final issue with Blackboard is this; much much better alternatives exist. I use a web-based, collaborative, management system featuring online document editing (not a Blackboard feature) and full timetabling support that can integrate with any major calendar application. Oh, and the website even works 24/7 (a rarity, I know). The name of this all-singing, all-dancing, quite fantastic tool is [Huddle](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-3731164-10712079). And I cannot recommend it enough.

Having recently announced their growing Microsoft Office integration (#1614), Huddle is a web-app that's going places... fast. The online editing facility can alter .doc and .xls files without a download being required. Audit trails are automatically established for *all* file transactions, a sample of a trail is pictured below;

Is Huddle the end of Blackboard? I sadly can't say so, the grade database of Blackboard is a feature that Huddle lacks, and it's undeniably a vital one. Though having seen how online document management can be done, it makes one shudder upon returning to the Blackboard environment.

I welcome your comments below, especially if your Blackboard experience is diametrically opposed to mine.
