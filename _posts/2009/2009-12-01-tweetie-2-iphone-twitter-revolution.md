You may have seen me bemoaning using Twitter on my iPhone recently.

This is for two reasons. First of all, it is [an original iPhone](/1337), and is therefore *terrible. *Second of all, I was using TweetDeck, which seems to be the only app in the store still free and not completely stuffed with ads - and also the slowest and most bloated.

Incidentally, no-one seems to have got syncing setup between platforms - iPhone, desktop, web etc. - sorted in a Twitter app. It can't be that hard, surely? @loic hinted this may be coming to [Seesmic](http://seesmic.com) at his PDC announcement, so let's hope it's soon.

Back to the job at hand - Tweetie 2. I have used this for about 20 minutes, and it's a masterpiece. Here's why.

## Super-easy, super-cool

Considering the number of options, bells and whistles that Tweetie 2 has integrated (seriously, you should see the length of the feature list), it is magnificently easy to use.

Within just a few seconds I had 5 accounts configured and was tweeting away to my heart's content. (This is in contrast to the purchase experience from Apple, which - for all the hoops it puts its developers through to get to the App Store - was a complete pain in the ass to actually get the app bought and downloaded).

Searches are also blindingly simple to set up, with a huge range of options there too.

Getting hold of users has never been easier.

## Geolocation, List and Retweet API

Tweetie 2 is on the cutting edge of Twitter API development, integrating both the geolocation and retweet APIs.

## Everything looks awesome

No matter where you go, the interface has been excellently thought out, and brilliantly designed and executed.

## So many buttons!

There's a lot of options and settings, and while it could have been easy to get lost, clear organisation makes it simple to get to the option you want.
