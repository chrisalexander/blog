As if you haven't already heard recently, the recent [Digital Economy Bill](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/nov/27/digital-economy-bill) has severe consequences for file-sharers and possibly more in the UK.

The full proposals are [summarised on DontDisconnect.us](http://www.dontdisconnect.us/the-proposals/) (set up by TalkTalk, the UK ISP), but it essentially boils down to this: the bill would require UK ISPs to monitor the traffic of their users, reporting to copyright owners when their content is illegally shared.

What I liked most about this is that today, @PatParslow posted a link to an online video (ironically backed by Lily Allen samples, who [recently had a go at file sharers](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8256607.stm)) lamenting the bill and asking Mandelson to sort it out. Here it is:
