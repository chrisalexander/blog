Following on from my recent post about the Facebook application [StalkerCheck](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/371), Mashable have a post recommending users [stay away from the application](http://mashable.com/2009/09/07/facebook-fan-check-virus-hoax/), recently renamed to Facebook Fan Check.

This is the language they use:

In any case, this is what you should do: <strong style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">stay away from Fan Check** application - or <strong style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">any other** Facebook application that hints at being able to tell you who's been visiting your profile. Furthermore, <strong style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">don't search for the "Fan Check Facebook virus,"** as it is most likely a hoax.

Watch out on Facebook people!
