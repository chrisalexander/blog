Would you like the chance to get your hands on [Beginning Android 3](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/5240)?

This book is an excellent guide to getting started building Android applications, ramping up from installing the SDK and setting up Eclipse right through to advanced Android APIs and development practices. We’ve got a copy to give away thanks to the lovely folks at Apress.

*To enter*: simply add a comment on this post telling us why you love Android (don’t forget to leave your e-mail address or we won’t be able to contact you!) and we’ll pick a winner at random. Don’t forget to say "hi" [on Google+](https://plus.google.com/107164677276760163853) too (not required for entry).

*Rules*: Closing date is 9pm UK time on Friday 19th August 2011. Winner will be picked at random. Prize will be available for collection from Reading or London; if you want it shipped to the UK or abroad please get in touch and we’ll see what we can do. One entry per person: multiple entries will void all of them.

Not lucky this time? [Grab it on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginning-Android-3-Mark-Murphy/dp/1430232978/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1313244015&sr=8-1).
