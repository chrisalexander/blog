So have you all heard of [Microsoft Surface](http://microsoft.com/surface)?

For those haven't, Surface represents a new way of not only interacting with computers, but also with each other.

Surface has a revolutionary design, of a large touch-interactive screen on the top of a table unit. This allows many users to gather around the table, and take advantage of the unit's massive multi-touch capacity (up to 150 fingers have been tracked simultaneously on the device - we would have tried more but that took 15 people to squeeze round the table as it was!).

At the MSP Launch Event at Microsoft TVP I was fortunate enough to be able to sit down and have a go on the surface on my own for a few minutes, and I recorded some video that I will be sharing with you over the next few weeks.

But first of all I would like to introduce Paolo Barone (@pbarone), who works in the Academic Developer Platform Evangelism (ADE) team at Microsoft UK, who was kind enough to record an exclusive video introducing Microsoft Surface to you.
