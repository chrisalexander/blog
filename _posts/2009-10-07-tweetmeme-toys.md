As I guess some of you may have gathered by now, we have quite a few little robotic bits and pieces laying around the TweetMeme office. From the Nabaztag and Pleo to both the Roombas, I thought we had it all.

Until the other day, that is, when I found a BB (you know those small plastic bullets used in slightly-more-than-toy guns) that one of the Roombas had picked up. I asked where it was from, Daniel (@dtsn) mentioned the remote control tank, and of course we had to get it out and have a go. Here's what happened:<span class="youtube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="505" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8x9oaDiNhwU?wmode=transparent&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=dark" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span>
