Yes I realise there have already been 2 posts about #ddd8, but there are a few more things that need to be finished off.

Last night was absolutely epic - a fitting end to a brilliant day.

Thanks have to go out to @zimakki for somehow getting nearly 40 starved nerds served at Pizza Express and then everyone in to Revolutions afterwards.

Also huge congratulations, once again, to the speakers and organisers, for doing a brilliant job of getting the entire day to run smoothly. See you at the next event!

Just a few related pictures to clear up the evening...
