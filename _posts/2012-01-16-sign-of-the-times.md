Tomorrow is my first lecture of what I have come to define as my final term at Uni.

I say it is my final term because the actual final term (which doesn't start until April and lasts until very nearly July) will consist of a couple of exams, a couple of robot demos then a whole lot of dossing off (not working, for those who thought what I just said was rude).

There's something else interesting that I've noticed having been through this "night before the start of term" thing more than a few times over the years. I think this is the first time I genuinely haven't been nervous about the day to come.

Whether it was junior school (where I was just ill), high school (where I really didn't want to be) or - I'm not afraid to admit - University, I never seem to have gotten over the pre-term apprehension. Except this time.

I should imagine this is largely because I'm going back to uni for a nice break. I can scale back on the work, do a bit of the "student" thing (not much, mind) and generally enjoy being sat at the back of a cold room slowly obtaining knowledge I'm likely not going to need past July 2nd.

I'm being cynical. I would be lying if I said I didn't love every single second of uni. Except when idiot classmates swear adamantly that Shanghai's not in China (this actually happened two weeks after I'd been there). Other than that it's all good.

It's also a sign of the times that my preparation for the lecture tomorrow is to charge and locate a new notebook for the digital pen and charge the iPad. If only I could have seen myself 5 years ago when I started this all off. It is 2012, after all.
