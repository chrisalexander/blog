Today we headed over to Westfield Stratford (the huge new shopping mall by the Olympics site) to have a look around, and to see the Olympics site a bit closer. 

Fortunately for us it turned out that it is super simple to get there - a quick walk to Hackney Central overground station and a 10-15 minute train ride later and we were deposited right outside the shopping centre.

By any measure this place is vast - two gigantic floors then another shopping street built on top of the roof! The anchor stores ate M&amp;S and John Lewis, and we headed straight to the latter because you can see the Olympic park from their store.
