The videos from PDC, Microsoft's Professional Developers Conference back in October are now online.

One of the most interesting videos is Anders Hejlsberg, a technical fellow at the developer devision in Microsoft, talking about asynchronous programming and how it will be integrated with the new versions of C# and VB coming out soon.

The team are tackling the asynchronous programming problem head-on and introducing some very clean syntax for quickly and easily dealing with code blocks you would like to handle asynchronously without requiring threading. Interestingly, this functionality can deliver some great speed improvements in ASP.NET web applications too (especially when calling external services) as well as on the client.

Check out the video below for a great introduction to asynchrony in C# 5.
