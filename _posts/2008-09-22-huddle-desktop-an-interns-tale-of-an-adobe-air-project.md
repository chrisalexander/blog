As some of you may or may not know (if you're on my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/chris_alexander) its highly likely you do), I spent 2 months and a bit of this summer working at a technology startup called Huddle in London.

Huddle's product is an online collaboration and document sharing website with an emphasis on social working, and could be described as a cool cross between the best of Sharepoint and Facebook, after being cleaned up and made to look lovely. You can check out their site at [Huddle.net](http://www.huddle.net).While I was there, one of the items on my (hugely long) list of things to do was to write an Adobe AIR desktop application to work with their shiny-shiny new API to provide cool functionality that the main website couldn't - drag and drop file uploading for example.

So, about 4 weeks and a massively complicated pile of Javascript later, the end result was published and open sourced [for the world to see](http://www.huddle.net/developers/huddle-desktop).

I'm immensely pleased with what I managed to achieve; I managed to do some serious debugging of their API, and I learnt so much about Javascript (from Nick, one of the UI guys at huddle) and CSS (from Jenna, the other UI person at huddle - huge UI department there ;)

To those of you who don't have a placement year in your degree, I would **highly** recommend trying to get something in the summer - mine came about by taking part in the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition, where I met Huddle's founder and product director Andy, who I then <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">harassed</span> nudged quite often until he agreed to let me come and work for them! The experience is invaluable, I had a great time and met some truly amazing people.
