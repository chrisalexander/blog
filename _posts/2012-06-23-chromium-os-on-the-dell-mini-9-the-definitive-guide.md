I have had a Dell Mini 9 laptop for a long time - probably at least three years. In that time it has struggled under Windows XP (it still has the "Designed for Microsoft Windows XP" sticker, niiiice), Windows 7, Ubuntu, Jolicloud and a few other OSs that didn't last more than a few minutes.

On each occasion it has proved horrendously under-powered. The most use I ever got out of it was carrying it around while my PC at home had remote desktop over the web enabled, and I could use it as a remote desktop terminal into that.

However just before my exams I realised Dell had the great vision to post some Chromium OS disk images which mean that you can quite easily revitalise your Dell Mini 9 with Chromium OS. I'm writing this post on it and let me assure you it is extremely quick!

To get started, you will need:

* A 4GB+ memory stick you don't need
* **An ethernet connection or a phone that supports tethering via USB** (more on this later)
* A half decent internet connection to run some downloads
* A couple of hours free
* A Dell Mini 9 (a 10 may work but I havne't tried it)
