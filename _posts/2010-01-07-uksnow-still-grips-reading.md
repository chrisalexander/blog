Today I resolved that I would not base my #Project365 picture on snow - as hard as that may be.

So I got rid of my urge to take snow pictures on my walk to work, and snapped these with my iPhone.

Fortunately the camera functions pretty well in the high-brightness light-bathed scenes in Reading today, so I think these came out pretty well.

I couldn't help but snap this helpless taxi left abandoned on Kendrick Road - the irony was just too much for me.

It also seems that my car has been burying itself in snow that has fallen off its bonet - this should be fun to dig out when I need it!
