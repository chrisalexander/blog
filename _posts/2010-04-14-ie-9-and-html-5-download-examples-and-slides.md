Thanks to everyone who came to my Reading Geek Night presentation about IE 9 and HTML 5 last night!

It was a pleasure talking to you all, and hopefully you got something out of the evening.

All my slides on the night were powered by HTML 5, so I have zipped them up (minus the space shuttle launch video - it was HD so quite a big file) and they are now available to download below.

Hopefully catch up with you all at an event soon!
