Today consisted of visiting new (for me at least) relatives - both sets of Wenni's grandparents. We also somehow managed to squeeze in more shopping time.

No pictures today but let me assure the home-cooked lunch and dinner (one from each set of grandparents) were delicious. Handmade dumplings (they were making them when we got there) for lunch and chicken wings, meatballs, fish and pork liver for dinner. Om nom nom :-)
