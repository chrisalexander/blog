Day 2 in SF.

I spent most of the day at Heavy Bit, working away on some tickets that needed closing. That space is absolutely something else - it is an order of magnitude better than anything in London - including Level 39 and Google Campus, arguably the best kitted out places for startups in the city.

Hot lunch is provided daily (I nearly missed it until I smelt the smells coming up through the building) but you have to get in quick - if you're not there by seconds it's all gone!

The place it kitted out like a palace. Four massive fully stocked fridges, cereals, snacks, a coffee machine where you choose and grind your beans yourself first, and iPads for booking meeting rooms.
