This will, according to WordPress, be my 1000th post published on this site.

<!-- Replace missing image from http://media.chris-alexander.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1000.jpeg -->

The first article was published way back on 8th September 2007 - making the site nearly five and a half years old. Since then I've written about a chaotic collection of topics, and the only consistency is in the fact that I, at some point, wrote it.

It's been through countless WordPress versions and several more themes (some more stylish than others, but it was always fun!) and grown and shrunk with how much I've used it.

If you want to dig into my past, [the Archive](/archive) is a good place to start.

Here's to the next 1000 / 5 years :-)
