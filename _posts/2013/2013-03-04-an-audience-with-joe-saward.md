Last Friday David and I went to "An Audience with Joe", an event run by F1 journalist Joe Saward. The format of the evening was question and answer (with a break for nibbles) and was hugely entertaining.

One of the topics that came up was Lewis Hamilton - and just why he decided to jump ship to Mercedes. Personally I'm interested to see how much patience he has - I give him 3 years there before he gets fed up and moves again.

There were a few other recurring topics, one of which was Bernie (of course). There were some interesting theories about what would happen when he retires - none of which were my first choice, which would be Ms Tamara taking over.
