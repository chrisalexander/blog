Today a LOT of code was written.

I also made it to 2 events in the evening. One at Klout was really fascinating - about how you use machine learning to grade 20,000 online course submissions. It's very interesting how they use various signals to correct for bias and so on in the peer grading process.

The other event was SF New Tech, which import.io was voted a very close third in. Literally one vote in it to tie for the lead!

I also got a cubic outlook.com stress ball (these things are important).
