Much like [last year](/on-engineering/formula-1/formula-1-bbc-tv-scheduling-calendar/), I have created a calendar to keep track of the BBC TV coverage of the F1. When combined with the [F1 calendar](http://www.f1calendar.com/), you can find out when the cars are on the track and when you can catch up with it on BBC TV (and when to avoid the news!).

How to view the calendar:

* Add this calendar to your Google Calendar: chris-alexander.co.uk_o0e839r3jgmth0tg3t3s3eea18@group.calendar.google.com
* [XML format](http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/chris-alexander.co.uk_o0e839r3jgmth0tg3t3s3eea18%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic)
* [iCal format](http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/chris-alexander.co.uk_o0e839r3jgmth0tg3t3s3eea18%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)
* [View as a web page](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chris-alexander.co.uk_o0e839r3jgmth0tg3t3s3eea18%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/London)
