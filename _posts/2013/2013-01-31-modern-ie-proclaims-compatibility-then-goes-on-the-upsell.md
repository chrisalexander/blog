Microsoft's new [Modern.IE](http://www.modern.ie) is labelled as: "Today it can take a lot of time to make your web experiences look great (or just work) across various browsers and devices. This tool detects common coding practices that may cause compatibility problems or prevent your users from getting the best possible experience on a webpage."

However, if you actually run a report, first of all you get a list of problems that make your site incompatible with IE (see the report for my site [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203051612/http://www.modern.ie/report)).

Then they go ahead and label as warnings two **Internet Explorer-specific** features such as touch compatibility and start screen icons - these are part of Windows 8 and use a -ms prefix CSS header and the other uses Microsoft meta tags.

Smooth.
