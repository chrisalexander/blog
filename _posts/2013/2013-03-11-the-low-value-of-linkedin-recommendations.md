LinkedIn's new Recommendations feature is causing some discussion in the office. You can see how there would be upsides to getting recommended for skills on LinkedIn. However, personally, I have decided against publishing ones I have received for now.

The primary reason for this is currently I am seeing a lot of people getting recommended for things that they probably do have good experience in, but the recommendation is devalued by who is recommending it. In a lot of cases, LinkedIn provides auto-filled recommendations for people to send, and the person sending the recommendation doesn't necessarily know a lot about the subject they are recommending someone for.

For example, if Sergey Brin were to recommend me for "Wearable computing"; Mark Zuckerberg for "social software"; or my boss for "AWS architecture" then I would content these are highly relevant, and valuable recommendations. However, people who have never worked together recommending each other for areas in which they are not experts - I would argue - devalues the system entirely.

I believe LinkedIn could help solve this problem by making sure people are aware of what they are doing before sending recommendations for these skills. They have done a good job of getting people sending skill recommendations - perhaps so well, that it has devalued the overall result.
