Most of today was involved in shopping for wedding things (and other bits and pieces).

Wenni's mum can't drive her car on Thursdays (everyone in Beijing gets a day of the week they can't) so we had to take the bus.

Fortunately this is insanely cheap. ¥1.6 (~16p) each way.

We had lunch at a Chinese fast food place. Their beef curry is insanely fast - so much so it was served just moments after we made the order. Also very tasty!

For dinner we are about to have Japanese noodles (brought straight from Japan on her recent trip) by Wenni's mum. It smells great and I can't wait to try it!
