As was pointed out this morning (by [LeMencs](http://twitter.com/LeMencs) on Twitter), [Tim Minchin](http://www.timminchin.com/blog/) will soon be making an appearance for [2 evenings at The Hexagon](http://www.timminchin.com/gigs/) in Reading. I listened to a few of Tim's pieces a while ago, and enjoyed them greatly. Here are a couple for your listening pleasure (you can see the rest on his[ Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/timminchin)).
