If you were programming C++ and had trouble remembering the name "scope resolution operator" (::) used for defining functions that are members of classes and other such object-oriented things, be glad you weren't being tested on PHP.

I have been looking up classes in PHP in order to develop a framework in PHP and Javascript to easily perform asynchronous client/server communications, and it turns out the scope resolution operator in PHP is named the "[Paamayim Nekudotayim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paamayim_Nekudotayim)".

This is due to the Isreali heritage of the Zend engine used in PHP, but rather difficult to remember (and a pain when you get an error message with that and you dont know what it is!)
