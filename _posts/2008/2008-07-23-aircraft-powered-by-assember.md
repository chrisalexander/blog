I was reading an article in a New Scientist magazine yesterday on the train to London and I came across an article discussing bugs in the software that power aircraft.

Software is becoming more and more important in aircraft as it controls and interferes in more and more transactions between the pilot and the aircraft.

I was very worried to begin with when I thought it said they were partly powered by C#, but I was slightly better after I realised it said C , as well as C and assembler.

I should hope that the people who program and test the assembler code do a good job, that stuff can be tempremental at best!
