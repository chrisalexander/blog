During my time developing Adobe Air applications, I have come across numerous online resources for support, and I have listed them here for reference.

[Air Developer Center](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/) - useful starting point on the Adobe site

[HTML Developer SDK](https://web.archive.org/web/20090210134910/http://www.adobe.com/products/air/tools/sdk/) - everything you need to use Notepad to develop Air apps

[Adobe Live Documents](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709130639/http://livedocs.adobe.com/air/1/devappshtml/help.html) - great documentation online

[Pocket reference guide PDF](http://onair.adobe.com/files/AIRforJSDevPocketGuide.pdf?sdid=CEYFA)

[Local filesystem reference](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:Articles:Apollo_Local_File_System)

[O'Reilly guide](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515195/index.html)

[Language reference online](http://web.archive.org/web/20100311074209/http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AIR/1.1/jslr/index.html)

That's some for now, I'll add more resources as I find them.
