I've just logged on to [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) for the first time for about 3 months, and I must say I'm very impressed!

Not only have they updated the whole interface so that finding various things is a lot easier, but the new presentation creator/editor is amazing. Sure it can't do everything yet, but the online collaboration features really do put everything else in the shade.

I still think improvements can be made, though, and even though all the fancy graphics and things do make it look nice, all that in the back end makes the whole experience generally a little sluggish. Other than that, though, I think I have grounds to use it a lot more at the moment!
