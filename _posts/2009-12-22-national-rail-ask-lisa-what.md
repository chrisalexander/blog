Earlier today @beardscratcher posted a link to the new National Rail "Web 2.0â€³ website with its new "rounded corners, drop-shadows, gradients &amp; reflections".

What interested me more was the "Ask Lisa" part, which is some kind of attempt to re-invent the chatty services from years gone by to make the site more "accessible" to more people.

But from the screenshot below, it looks like more people had been asking about Lisa herself, rather than the service she was designed to talk about - check out the "Recently Asked Questions"...
