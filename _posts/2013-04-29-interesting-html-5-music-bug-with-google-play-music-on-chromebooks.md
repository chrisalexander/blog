I went to [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music/listen) earlier to listen to some tracks while coding (because you can do all these things on Chromebooks) and was quite entertained and irritated that all my music was playing about 3x the regular speed.

Turns out it's because I turned on the experimental HTML 5 playback. In the cog menu, go to labs and turn that off (and play with some of the other cool features in there) and everything will be back to normal.
