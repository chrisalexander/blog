Since I've been at the University of Reading, every weekday I've cycled through the Earley Gate entrance at least twice. Standing there are two gatehouses, which when I first arrived were looking very sad and dilapidated.

Last week some scaffolding appeared, and most of this week various builders have been on the site generally making a mess of the ground around it, presumably looking for cables and things.

I'm not sure what they're going to do, whether it's just a bit of maintenance, a full renovation or they're going to take them down. It would be nice to see them fully restored to watch over the entrance because they could be quite impressive.
