The 2009 F1 season had a lot to be remembered for.

The rise of Brawn and Jenson Button; the fall of Ferrari, McLaren, and Renault; the successes of Force India, and the staleness of Williams and Toro Rosso. Don't forget Red Bull, contenders to the end, and Rubens Barichello.

Even before the season finale in Abu Dhabi, 2010 had a lot to live up to. But it looks like it may do that, and more.

So what is there to come?

Only the return of Michael Schumacher. I think that's pretty epic on its own. Check out the BBC's [exclusive interview](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8428353.stm) with him about that.

There's been a lot of speculation on whether he will still be able to compete, whether he will win races or even the championship; personally I think it will be pretty exciting anyway. Jenson, Lewis, Fernando and Michael all on the same grid should lead to astounding racing.

A load of major car manufacturers have also pulled out - including BMW.

There are also several new teams entering - 4 in total. That should make for a fascinating battle between them, and hopefully they will all make as explosive an entry as Brawn last year.

All in all, I think its shaping up pretty well.
