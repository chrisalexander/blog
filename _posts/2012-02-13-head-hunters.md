Just had a phone call from a "London based head hunting agency". Sounds dangerous.

They proceeded to ask me about my current work situation and whether they could help me find a job. I politely declined, telling them I am completely busy at the moment and I am perfectly capable of finding myself a job if I were to require one now or in the future.

Failing to take this hint, they enquired as to my current work situation, for the express purpose of potentially getting in touch later. I told them that they should do their research first: a simple Google search of my name would give you probably everything you needed to know and more about my work situation at the moment. I then told them (again) that I do not require their help. They hung up rudely.

They clearly took my advice: a few seconds later a LinkedIn invite appeared for someone from a London based head hunting agency. I reported it as spam.

Here are some tips for recruiters looking to get in touch:

* Read [On Communication](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/5317). It's only short and will tell you that phoning me isn't a great idea. I won't call you back if you miss me and there is an overwhelming probability that you will interrupt me doing something important (contrary to popular belief I do not have the time or will to sit around doing nothing at any point in the day).
* Do your research. [Here's my LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisalexanderuk). [Here's some search results for my name](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=chris+alexander) (if you can't pick out the right person you're in the wrong job). Congratulations, you've already found my website. If you're going to interrupt me at least have a damned good idea who I am before you do it. If you have a good idea who I am (and you are capable of reading the previous bullet point) then you won't call me to begin with.
* Don't add me on LinkedIn. LinkedIn says: "Important: Only invite people you know well and who know you." Note: a rude phone call interrupting me and trying to get information out of me that is already available online does not in any way constitute me knowing you. I will simply report you as spam. This will prevent you contacting me in the future, unless you can figure out my e-mail address (which is not rocket science either - if you can't do that either you're still in the wrong job).
* You can send me a LinkedIn message.

Thanks to the person that phoned me this morning for reminding me to write this post. No thanks to them for wasting 15 minutes of my time.

**Update:** It appears this person called at least one of the companies I do some work for and tried to talk to me using the age-old "I'm calling about a delivery". If you try that I will never talk to you again and take great care to instruct everybody I possibly can to avoid you as much as possible.
