Following on from my exclusive video of Paolo Barone (@pbarone) introducing us to Microsoft Surface, I had a chance to have another play with the revolutionary device, and shoot some more video.

Here I have a deeper dive into the world of Surface: the applications, the user experience, its use in the real world and more. Check out the complete Surface experience, including demo programs illustrating how Surface could very soon be part of our everyday lives.
