I have been trying to answer a question recently about Google+ profiles. I know a good one when I see one, but what exactly makes it great?

### Examples

Let's see some examples of great Google+ profiles.

[Michael Mahemoff](https://plus.google.com/+MichaelMahemoff/posts) - from the header image down, this is a great read.

[Abraham Williams](https://plus.google.com/+AbrahamWilliams/posts) - great content and links, and they all look awesome too.

[Alain Vongsouganh](https://plus.google.com/+AlainVongsouvanh/posts) - a *lot* of Google Glass, but nice animations!

[Christian Cantrell](https://plus.google.com/+ChristianCantrell/posts) - excellent commentary on everything that's shared

[Ford](https://plus.google.com/+ford/posts) - the only company on the list makes good use of all the features.

### Key points

So what actually makes these good? Here are my key takeaways:

* Use the platform for what it is. So many company accounts which are just copy-and-paste of their Tweets!
* Use all the features - link sharing should use the "Link" option, not pasted into the bottom of the message body.
* Post galleries - Google+ has some of the best support for galleries of pictures, and they look awesome on mobile.
* Interact with the community - Ford even uses photos from its photo community on its posts!
* Post GIFs - bit of extra work, but a little bit of animation in a picture really draws the eye.
