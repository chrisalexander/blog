There's something quite special about the Boiling Egg.

Also known as Beijing's National Centre for the Performing Arts, you can see how it got its name:

Inside, it is no less spectacular. You enter through an underwater passageway, and this window extends up and all the way to the middle of the ceiling.

Meanwhile, this is the view out:

At night, it is all lit up inside, and you can clearly see the acoustically designed ceiling panels.

The acoustics inside the building are amazing. It has been designed very thoroughly.

It sounds both at once peaceful and busy, the hustle and bustle of the visitors is muted but always there, making the vast space seem less empty.

Outside in the evening it is no less spectacular, smoothly blending across a wide spectrum of colours.
