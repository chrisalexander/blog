Sitting innocently this morning just after I fired up Digsby, I discovered something I didn't really like the look of.

I *think* it just inserted an advert into my timeline of tweets that appears when you hover over the Twitter account icon. It's not appeared in my main window, but just in this preview section.

Given their recent history of screwing over users for money without telling them, they should be careful as I could very quickly get rid of it in favour of something else.

*Update* - Looks like they've been doing this for [some time](http://mashable.com/2009/12/22/riotwise-trending-ads/).

*Update 2* - Steve from Digsby points out in the comments below that this was released in [Build 76](http://web.archive.org/web/20160609185716/http://blog.digsby.com/archives/1255), and is disabled through your settings. Thanks for getting in touch, Steve.
