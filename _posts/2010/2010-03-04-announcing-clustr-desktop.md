Today I am extremely happy to announce the public availability of [Clustr Desktop](http://web.archive.org/web/20120107035949/http://clustr.me.uk/desktop/).

[Clustr Desktop](http://web.archive.org/web/20120107035949/http://clustr.me.uk/desktop/) has been over a year in the making, and 18 months since its [first release under the guise of Huddle Desktop](http://web.archive.org/web/20110507004458/http://blog.huddle.net/announcing-huddle-desktop), it has now been rewritten, upgraded, polished and rebranded enough for you all to start making some serious use out of it.

Clustr Desktop is a great companion to [Clustr Mobile](http://web.archive.org/web/20100427015247/http://clustr.me.uk/mobile/). It allows you to view your Huddle workspaces, folders and files from a desktop application. This means you can do some super-cool things such as *drag and drop file uploads and downloads*, as well as making managing your Huddle files a breeze.

Here's a full run-down of what you can expect from [Clustr Desktop](http://web.archive.org/web/20120107035949/http://clustr.me.uk/desktop/):

* View your Workspaces, Folders and Files
* What's New feeds for Workspaces
* View detailed information on Files
* For Windows, Mac OSX and Linux
* All-new code for Version 2
* No private data stored, saved passwords encrypted

There's a couple of additional benefits too. Just like [Clustr Mobile](http://web.archive.org/web/20100427015247/http://clustr.me.uk/mobile/), it's always going to be free to use and free of adverts (forever!). On top of this, the code is also **fully open source** under the BSD license, so hop on over to the [project page](http://code.google.com/p/clustrdesktop) to check it out and get modifying!

I have also gone ahead and created some mailing lists for various users of the application:

* [clustrdesktop-development](http://groups.google.com/group/clustrdesktop-development) for development chatter
* [clustrdesktop-release-announce](http://groups.google.com/group/clustrdesktop-release-announce) for release announcements
* [clustrdesktop-users](http://groups.google.com/group/clustrdesktop-users) for user discussion and support

If you're looking for support for Clustr Desktop, you have the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/clustrdesktop-users) or the [ticketing system](http://code.google.com/p/clustrdesktop/issues/list) as options to report your problem, and a developer will get back to you within a few hours.

Check out some screenshots of Clustr Desktop below:
