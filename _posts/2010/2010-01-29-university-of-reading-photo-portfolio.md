A few weeks ago, the [Microsoft Student Rally](http://www.microsoft.com/student/en/us/rally/) was brought to my attention - a photography competition for students to capture photos of their favourite places at their University.

The idea is to take some stills of the best bits of your campus, put them online for everyone to see, and win some pretty awesome prizes at the same time.

For other competitions like this, you can become a fan of [Microsoft Student on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/microsoftstudent).

Check out my photos below. You can also [vote for my entry](http://www.msstudentlounge.com/studentrally/tabid/81/Default.aspx) if you like them! (Just search for Chris A or University of Reading - the competition site is terrible!!)

I took a contrasting set, showing the other side of the University, which I will also publish in the next few days.
