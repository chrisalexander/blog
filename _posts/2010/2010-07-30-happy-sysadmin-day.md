Today is [Sysadmin Day](http://www.sysadminday.com) - a day for thanking our sysadmins for all the hard work they do in order to keep our networks running smoothly, machines up and websites alive.

To say thanks to the awesome TweetMeme sysadmin team Alex (@alexforrow) and Carl, I have prepared a present in the medium I know best - lolcats.

So thanks to them for all the stupid hours, ridiculous "hacks", 24/7 messaging alerts, teaching my newb self how to use the linux command line, and my constant "Aleeeeex, why doesn't this work?" when I've made PHP segfault. Scroll down for the sysadmin-related lolcat gallery.
