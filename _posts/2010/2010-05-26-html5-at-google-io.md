Wow, HTML 5 had a brilliant time at [Google IO](http://web.archive.org/web/20101003174625/http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/) last week. Here's a recap of some of the top news coming from the event regarding the technology.

## Sports Illustrated HTML 5 App

While Murdoch may not know what the Internet is (so much so he decided just to break the paradigm with his paywalls), at least some people from the old industry are starting to see some sense regarding the web.

Sports Illustrated demoed a really awesome incarnation of their magasine built entirely in HTML 5, including articles, videos, interactive galleries and more.

Check out what [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/19/sports-illustrated-html5/) had to say about the site.

## Adobe HTML 5 Pack

Adobe announced the release of the HTML 5 pack for Dreamweaver CS 5 to coincide with Google IO.

The pack allows Dreamweaver to autocomplete, give sample renderings, and export HTML 5 versions of websites created with the application.

At the same time, Adobe announced that the VP8 codec will be supported by Flash, which will be upgraded by the end of the year to support Google's open source video format for the web.

## TweetDeck in HTML 5

The TweetDeck guys have also been pretty busy.

As part of the Chrome Web App Store launch, they demoed a version of TweetDeck built entirely in HTML 5. It features everything you'd expect from TweetDeck, including multiple platform support. Personally, I can't wait to see it in action on mobile browsers, expecially with the impending release of Android 2.2 with the V8 Javascript engine.

## Google Fonts API

One final mention for [Google's Fonts API](http://web.archive.org/web/20110206204359/http://code.google.com/webfonts).

This allows anyone to use a series of free fonts in their HTML 5 web pages.

It works in a similar way to how Google and Microsoft distribute Javascript libaries through the [Google AJAX Libraries](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/) and the [Microsoft AJAX CDN](http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/cdn.ashx) respectively. Essentially the font files are heavily cached, allowing your site to speed up by the client not loading the fonts if they have done so from one of the CDNs before.
