Recently I read an interesting post on Marc My Words entitled "11 Characteristics of Highly Successful Blog(ger)s".

Being a leading evangelist at Microsoft UK, you'd expect him to know a thing or two about blogging, but he does seem overly critical of himself in his evaluation.

In an attempt to see how well I am getting on with this blogging lark - especially since I have been putting considerably more effort into my site - I have filled in my thoughts on my progress.

From one post every few months to almost daily now, I think the site has had a bit of a revolution - and a huge increase in traffic - to show for my effort.

If you have any feedback about what I've written, or you agree or disagree, drop it in the comments below.

### Consistency

Consistency of publishing is definitely helping in terms of traffic, users and feedback.

Consistency of topics is something I've never been very good at - hopefully this is made up for in my categorisation and tagging of content. However, I am aware the tag and category pages could be considerably better. Maybe that's something that could be worked on too.

### Eloquence

This is something I always try and maintain when I'm writing; quite how successful I am remains to be seen.

There's no point providing great content if you present it poorly and in a manner that is difficult to understand. I make every effort to ensure posts written late at night are sanity checked before they go out, but I'm well aware sometimes there are sentences and paragraphs - and on a couple of occasions, entire posts - that I've looked at after they've been published, wondered what I was on about, and re-written.

Grammar and spelling is something I really make sure are right - there's nothing that annoys me more than poor writing in that way.

### Uniqueness

Well I try and make sure my post's content is unique at least. And I think the custom theme goes some way to helping that too. Hopefully I can offer something over what you would find elsewhere.

### Specific

Haha not really. Often my posts are either short and specific to a particular topic, but I am also well aware sometimes my more philosophical pieces can turn into long winding essays skipping from topic to topic and all over the place.

While I do enjoy writing those, I should probably not do it so much!!

### Personal

Not entirely certain what this means.

What I write here is my own content and always my own words (unless quoting or a guest author, of course) so hopefully it offers a unique perspective. I also target some posts to a certain audience, but beyond that they are all fairly general.

### Analytical

Not as often as I'd like to be. Several of my posts are comment, many are opinion, and I hope most are informative. I think this is something I would like to do more and will try and dig up something to be analytical about.

### Detail

Rarely.

Many of my posts are overviews, and give readers a taste of whatever I am writing about, but its rare that I do go into detail. When I do, it turns into a monolithic posts that tends to be difficult to read. Perhaps I should work on more detail but keeping the post succinct.

### Thought-Provoking

Most of my posts are designed to be informative; sometimes I will throw in a question in the closing paragraph to give readers something to think about, but not much more than that.

I think this goes hand in hand with being more specific and analytical.

### Passion

I hope I convey the passion I have for the topics I write about here. If I find the time to write about it, then it must be something I care a lot about, but I'm not sure this always shows in my writing. Perhaps with time and practice - it seems a long time since GCSE English!

### Instructional

In some posts, I aim to provide a clear set of instructions to perform a particular action, but as I said earlier, when I am writing about something new I often provide an overview and leave the instruction to links to other sites.

Maybe this is something I need to work on, as I have been writing wiki pages for a project I've been working on recently, and found them to be less than sufficient despite my best efforts working on them

### Networked

A post can never be well-enough networked. I put particular effort into tagging and categorisation, and trackback wherever possible (on larger sites this can be quite the traffic driver). This post was inspired by a long chain of other posts from the original, though, and I hope it will inspire a few more.
