The new series of Doctor Who continues tonight at 6.30pm on BBC 1.

Even only 2 episodes in, this series is shaping up particularly well. Excellent writing from the new team, great visual effects, and gorgeous shooting - all of the episodes look visually stunning.

There is, of course, the other reason that just about every man in the country will be tuning in (more after the break).
