My first "Promoted Account" showed up in the #newtwitter interface a little earlier.

Along with Promoted Trends and Top Tweets, Promoted Accounts are suggestions based on who you follow in order to follow the related - promoted - account. So far they've kept quite well out of the way for the ones I'm not interested in, and this is a seemingly appropriate one given the F1 link.
