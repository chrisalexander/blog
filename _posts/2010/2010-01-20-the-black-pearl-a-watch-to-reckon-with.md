It takes some considerable effort for me to pay attention to a watch; there is so much choice around it has to be something special.

The Black Pearl, designed by Switzerland-based [HD3 Complication](http://www.hd3complication.com/), definitely meets this standard.

A combination of steampunk exposed mechanisms and pirate and buccaneer-inspired elements, it features a mixture of intricate mechanisms and detailing, and chunky nautical fixtures.

Custom-engraved panels, a cannon hatch and a ship's wheel-like dial complete the unique and extremely attractive piece.

Good luck getting your hands on it, though: it is available at only a few select shops worldwide, and I couldn't find a price for it.
