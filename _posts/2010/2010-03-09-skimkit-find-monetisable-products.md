Over the past few months I've been playing on and off with Skimlinks, a UK-based service providing easy monetisation of outbound links for websites. You may have also seen my post about [how excellent their customer service is](/2188).

My desktop Huddle client, Clustr, wasn't the only Adobe AIR application to launch last week. Skimlinks also announced the release of [Skimkit](http://skimlinks.com/skimkit), their tool for publishers to find relevant products for their website.

From the [Skimkit website](http://skimlinks.com/skimkit):

Filled with a live database of millions of products from Skimlinks merchants, SkimKit changes the way you research content; saving you time, and providing you with more targeted and relevant results, right to your desktop.

Skimkit is a great way for any publisher to research products that are instantly monetisable through Skimlinks. It provides a fantastic search across for main categories of products to help you get what you want faster. It also provides a link to an image of the product you can use right away, as well as a link to the product page that the Skimlinks code will pick up from your site and monetise for you.

Some other cool features include built-in URL shortening with the Skimlinks shorteners, and a favourite function where you can star a set of products to save for later. You can then export the list as XML or CSV - incredibly useful!

There's a full set of screenshots for the installation and first run of Skimkit below. [Sign up for Skimlinks](http://skimlinks.com/register) now if you want to get your hands on it.
