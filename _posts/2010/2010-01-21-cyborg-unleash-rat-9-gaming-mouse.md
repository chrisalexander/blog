[Cyborg Gaming](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823171115/http://www.cyborggaming.com/) have unleashed their R.A.T. 9 gaming mouse - and it looks absolutely stunning.

It's not short on features too; adjustable size, weighting and thumb rests, metal chassis, 5600 DPI laser with a button by your thumb to up the DPI even higher, and its wireless with rechargeable batteries.

Ars Technica has a [glowing review](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/01/rat-9-mouse-long-on-features-michael-bay-good-looks.ars), but in the mean time I'll just let you rest your eyes on this piece of art for a while longer.
