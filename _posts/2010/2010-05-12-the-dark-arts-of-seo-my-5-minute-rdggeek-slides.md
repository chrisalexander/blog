Thanks to everyone who came along yesterday to #rdggeek 7, I know I had a great evening and really enjoyed the other presentations.

My 5-minute presentation ramble about SEO was hopefully useful in at least a little way to some people, and just in case you want more of my lolcat-infused musings then you can feel free to go grab the slides from below.

As I said on the night (or at least I think I did), please don't take this as a magic potion to solve all your SEO woes overnight, because that will only end up with you unhappy, a lawsuit, expensive trials and me feeling the wrath of "SEO experts" all over the world...
