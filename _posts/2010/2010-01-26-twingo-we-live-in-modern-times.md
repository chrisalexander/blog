Last night I noticed another Renault Twingo ad that has appeared ok UK television.

I guess it probably just appeals to my "unique" brand of humour, but I think these ads are genius.

Pity about the car, though.

Also, kudos to Renault for getting these up on an official YouTube channel. Finally marketers are getting the idea!!
