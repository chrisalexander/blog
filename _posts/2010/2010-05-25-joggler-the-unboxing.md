So you may have seen TweetMeme went a little Joggler-crazy last week, with a grand total of 6 turning up in our office (although not all at the same time).

This is because Dom turned up one day, said they were on offer for Â£50, showed us all the software and hardware hacks, and we were all completely sold!

I'd like to tell you about all the hacks we've managed so far a little later on. But for now, here are some unboxing shots and the default OS in action.

The base software for the Joggler is Ubuntu, but this has been hijacked into a clunky and frankly terrible Flash-based frontend, which they expect you to build apps for.

On the inside, this thing has some stupidly powerful kit - a dual-core Atom chip, 512mb total ram, and a wifi chip and Alex discovered it has gigabit ethernet too.

If you get one of these, the first thing you'll want to do is load up a memory stick and boot it into a different OS. But more on that later ;-)
