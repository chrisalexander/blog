Recently I had a bit of a problem on my netbook when Office 2010 decided not to activate for whatever reason.

I tried a wide variety of things (it didn't seem too keen on fixing itself), and eventually came upon the following solution:

* Go to Control Panel
* Select "Uninstall a program"
* Find Office 2010 Beta, right click and select "Change"
* Choose the fourth option, "Enter a product key"
* Enter the product key you got with the download
* Let it continue and run the wizard
* When you restart your Office applications, it will ask you to validate online then you will be activated!
* You may have to restart again to make the messages go away.
