Last night I went along to the #digitalsurrey event at the new Surrey Sports Park facility at the University of Surrey.

It was a bit of a trek down there in the heat and traffic, but it was well worth the visit. The sports park is a fantastic facility (it has a huuuuge climbing wall) and the event itself was extremely good.

The presentation was interesting and the ensuing debate was good too. I had some fascinating conversations afterwards too, and look forward to the next event in a month or so.

Took a few pictures which I've added below.
