Tonight I will be presenting at the Reading Geek Night (#rdggeek on Twitter), on the subject of "IE 9 and the Future of the Web".

Why not come along? It's at 7.30 at Copa bar in central Reading ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=copa&amp;sll=51.445892,-0.964886&amp;sspn=0.009656,0.022359&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=copa&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=51.454585,-0.965198&amp;spn=0.002413,0.00559&amp;z=18&amp;iwloc=A)), and is a great opportunity to meet and catch up with local geeks.

I'll be talking about the latest Platform Preview of IE 9, and some very cool new technology that is in the works for all the major web browsers, in the shape of HTML 5.

Hope to see you there!
