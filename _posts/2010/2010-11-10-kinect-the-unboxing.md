Following up from the exclusive Kinect videos last week (#4262), here is the unboxing of the Kinect device just hours after it launched in the UK. I've had a bit of a play and it is *brilliant*, but there are all kinds of gameplay and action videos in store for you so I won't spoil the surprise for you...

On with the photos!
