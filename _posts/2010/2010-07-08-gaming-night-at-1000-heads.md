Last night I was invited along to 1000 Heads in London for a gaming night.

I had already met quite a few of the people there at the recent Geek Quiz, but there was a load of new people to meet as well which was great. Add to that a big stack of free pizza, beer, gaming-themed cupcakes, the world cup on a big screen and just about every game console I could remember, and it was a pretty epic night.

Sadly my Mario Kart skills weren't quite up to scratch, failing to make the final of the competition, but that was more than made up for by some seriously entertaining gaming, conversation and laughs with everyone there.

Check out the short video I took the opportunity of shooting below - pictures to follow.
