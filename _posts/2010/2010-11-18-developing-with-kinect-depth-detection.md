I've been busy hacking around with Kinect, the Xbox 360 "controllerless controller" [I've been](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/on-engineering/microsoft/kinect-the-unboxing/) [writing a lot](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/on-engineering/microsoft/an-exclusive-look-at-kinect/) [about recently](http://www.chris-alexander.co.uk/on-engineering/life/kinect-hands-on-video/).

Yesterday I got it up and running under Ubuntu, and after that I got a very simple "nearest object" algorithm running on it. Check out the videos below! Also - [the code](https://github.com/siu07cja/libfreenect).
