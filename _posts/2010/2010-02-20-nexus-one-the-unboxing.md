So here it is, the unboxing of the Nexus One.

More about what I think of the phone itself are to come soon; but this is just a really early glance at the device. I couldn't even turn it on for a few hours because it was charging (and I was supposed to be working).

Couple of things I will say for it though; first of all its a truly stunning piece of hardware. It also gave my camera an extremely hard time because it is so shiny and there was so much light - so excuse the slightly blurry ones.

The packaging was excellent too, very sturdy, well put together and thoughtful throughout. I liked the Google 4-colour accents around the bottom rim of the box - a nice touch.

Without further ado, on to the gallery!
