So yesterday @Loic and [Seesmic](http://seesmic.com) dropped a bit of a bomb - [Seesmic Look](http://seesmic.com/seesmic_desktop/look/), yet another Twitter client from the Seesmic team (in addition to their [Android](http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/android/), [Blackberry](http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/blackberry/), [Web](http://seesmic.com/app), [Desktop](http://seesmic.com/seesmic_desktop/air/), [Windows](http://seesmic.com/seesmic_desktop/windows/), [Twhirl ](http://www.twhirl.org/)and Ping.fm products).

So how could you possibly justify yet another Twitter app for Windows on top of the *four* that you can already access from a Windows desktop?

There's some really cool features of Look that I think justify it being there. Let's take a *Look*.

## User Interface

For me the interface is very Media Center-esque - I can imagine it would be extremely easy to navigate with a remote control. Twitter on your TV anyone?

## Advanced Twitter support

Lists, retweets, trending topics, searches and saving searches, favourites and with the addition of channelisation of users, it has it all in there out of the box.

## Playback View

This is one of the coolest features for me.

It basically allows you to play back a particular timeline, in such a way that it looks quite nice and is great on a big monitor.

I can imagine it being really useful on trade stands, in offices, and other places where you want to share a Twitter stream, list, parts of your personal timeline, or searches on a big screen.
