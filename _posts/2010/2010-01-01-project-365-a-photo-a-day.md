So one of this year's New Year Resolutions (inspired by @amykate's tweets) is to take one photo a day for the entire year.

Sounds pretty challenging, especially for forgetful ol' me, so I think its high time we got some kind of plan together to get this going.

I've set up the @365_project Twitter account, which will take a feed of entries that I publish tagged with Project365 on my blog and post them automatically.

If you're looking to take part, and want your photos included on the account, just comment or send me a message with the RSS URL for your photos.

*Please make sure it is only photo links in the RSS feed or I will remove it :)*

I'm off out to take my first photo - what will yours be?
