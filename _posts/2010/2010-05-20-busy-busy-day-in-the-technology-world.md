Wow, what a day yesterday was!

Google went all-out at their Google IO event, and went and changed all kinds of things.

[Google Wave](http://wave.google.com) announcements, a new codec for the web supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera, and all kinds of other fancy bits and pieces.

On top of this, Twitter for iPhone made it into the app store, so I can load that up and have a bit of a play with that too.

Look out for posts over the next few days on all of these - there's still Day 2 of Google IO to come, where I'm probably going to get extremely excited about Android announcements!
