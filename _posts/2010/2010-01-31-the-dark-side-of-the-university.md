On Friday I posted some photos (#2316) of the University of Reading's London Road campus, which I had entered in a competition (still time [to vote](http://www.msstudentlounge.com/studentrally/tabid/81/Default.aspx)! Search for Chris A or University of Reading - the competition site is terrible).

They were the nice, shiny, red brick side of the London Road campus.

As I went off in search of more unique and slightly more abstract photos, I came across what seemed to be another world shielded by the manicured bushes and neat paths.
