Seesmic, the popular Twitter, Facebook and Buzz client previously available for Windows, Web, Android, Blackberry, and a whole pile of other platforms, has recently made its iPhone application available.

Many questioned whether there would be any point in Seesmic releasing an iPhone app, with the recent news and release of Twitter for iPhone, a rebrand of the extremely popular Tweetie application.

But surprisingly, the application has received [critical acclaim](http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/21/seesmic-iphone/).

By implementing more than one platform, and combining this with an innovative multi-panel interface for quick and easy navigation, Seesmic for iPhone is similarly pitched to Seesmic for Android - for the power users who want to get the most out of their device while they're on the go.

Check out some screenshots of Seesmic for iPhone in action below.
