I don't know about you, but among many of my friends I am often called upon first in any case of computer trouble. (I literally mean *any* in this case.)

Now don't get me wrong, I try to be a nice person and I definitely don't mind helping someone out once in a while, and when they have tried themselves to fix the problem.

However, I do take exception to being constantly SMS'd, e-mailed, called and generally harassed about *every single little problem*. I get IMs while I'm trying to work, texts while I'm trying to sleep, and people seem to think that I will be able to diagnose and solve their printer driver problems over the phone, and will be able to get them to understand that *to validate Windows you need a valid license* by text. (No, I don't know where you can get valid licenses from. Try a shop.)

So maybe this is a bit harsh. But I really don't mind helping out occasionally; please try not to bombard me with computer problems and I'll try to remain sane - deal?
