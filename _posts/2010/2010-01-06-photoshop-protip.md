Here's a quick tip for Photoshop that I have came across and I find incredibly useful.

When I'm mixing photos for Project 365 in Photoshop, I often find myself wanting to take a snapshot of my current edit as a single layer, for example to try a transform on the whole image.

You can very quickly and easily do this with two shortcuts that I find invaluable.

Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N creates a new layer, then Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E takes a snapshot of all the current layers and pastes it onto the new layer you just created.

I usually select the top layer so that this then appears above all the other layers and you can transform and play around with it as much as you like without trashing all your other layers.
