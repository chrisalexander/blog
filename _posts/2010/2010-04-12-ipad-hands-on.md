So an iPad turned up at work last week, and I got to have a bit of a play. Here are my first impressions, and some pics and video.

The first thing I noticed is that the iPad is actually a lot heavier than I was expecting it to be. It also has a very rounded back, so typing on it with it resting on a flat surface is out of the question.

The apps also leave a lot to be desired. It seems that almost all of them were rushed out to be part of the first release with the iPad, and therefore not completely thought out and working well. TweetDeck is the worst of them, it is a truly ghastly experience to use (but then, so are all the other TweetDeck platform apps).

I'm still tempted by one, but it would have to be the cheapest model - I see no value in it being 3G and having massive storage. It's more of a coffee table device for picking up and using, and basically a portal to the internet.

Check out the video and gallery of the iPad in action below.
