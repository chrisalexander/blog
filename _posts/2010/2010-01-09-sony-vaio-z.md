Yesterday at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Sony released this very very nice preview video for the even nicer Sony Vaio Z.

Some of the features include backlit keyboard, nVidia graphics, a "Dynamic Hybrid Graphics System" (whatever one of those is), built in webcam, a rumoured 4 SSDs in RAID, Windows 7, Core i5 Processor, some really nice brushed metal and presumably a hefty price tag.

Check out the video embedded below. I could be very tempted by one of these, but as with all things Sony, put off by the price tag.
