Windows Phone 7 has been quietly bubbling away in the background for the past few weeks with Android's Froyo update and iPhone 4 laying waste to any big news about the platform.

But I've been keeping my eye on what's been going on, and have been interested to hear on a few developments that have been announced for the platform.

Rumours abound that Windows Phone 7 devices will be [shipped out to select developers](http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/07/windows-phone-7-devs-said-to-be-getting-test-hardware-very-soon/) very soon, and that some devices have been spotted [booting in sub-30 seconds](http://web.archive.org/web/20110719062205/http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2010/06/11/windows-phone-7-handset-spotted-booting-in-under-30-seconds/) (that far outstrips iPhone and Android!).

Back to the more solid news, and there is a fun demo of the interface on the Windows Phone 7 site. An interesting perspective into how the platform differs in its user experience from iPhone and especially from Android.

Keep an eye on this post as it's updated with more information as I find it.
