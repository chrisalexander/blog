Yesterday Apple went and busted out iOS 4.2 for iPad, coming (discouragingly late in the year) in November. With it they also got some people from Epic Games up on stage to demo one of their creations.

The game "Project Sword" is still in the works, but I can tell you now it looks brilliant. This is because they have released a preview of the Citadel area of the game as a free app for iPhone and iPad. The free app is simply a walkaround where you can just run around the Citadel area (no other people to meet as yet, and you can't go in many places).

The game uses the Unreal engine ported to iOS, which makes for some absolutely superb and quite frankly mind-blowing realtime 3D rendering.

I included some screenshots of [Epic Citadel](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/epic-citadel/id388888815?mt=8#) below for your viewing pleasure.
