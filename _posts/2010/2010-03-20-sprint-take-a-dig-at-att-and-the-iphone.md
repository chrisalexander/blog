Just noticed this video from Sprint, the US mobile network, advertising their 4G mobile WiFi hotspot.

The device connects to Sprint's 4G (and 3G and so on) mobile network and provides connectivity as a WiFi network to those in the local area - pretty cool. Especially when it's taking a dig at the iPhone!
