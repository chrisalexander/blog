A few nights ago, the TweetMeme team was invited to DediPower's launch party for their latest datacenter. Fortunately enough I was able to go along, and along with the great conversation, catching up with friends from DediPower, and nice food and drink, the highlight of the evening was a live performance by Una and the Balkan Bears.

I won't go into too much detail of their history as you can get it on their myspace page. However I will say that they were brilliant live. Great fun to watch, awesome music, and outstanding skill. I did find myself turning around a few times and saying that that kind of skill just shouldn't be allowed!

It was a brilliant evening and if anyone gets the chance to catch them while they're over here I highly recommend it. Some pictures and video embedded below.
