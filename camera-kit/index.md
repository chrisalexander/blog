[Canon 5D mark iii](http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canon.co.uk%2Ffor_home%2Fproduct_finder%2Fcameras%2Fdigital_slr%2Feos_5d_mark_iii%2F) ([MPB](http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpb.com%2Fen-uk%2Fused-equipment%2Fused-photo-and-video%2Fused-digital-slr-cameras%2Fused-canon-digital-slr-cameras%2Fcanon-eos-5d-iii%2F)); Canon battery grip; [Peak Design Clutch](http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Fclutch) and [Clip](http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fproducts%2Fcapture-clip-only%2F).

I bought this body used in the summer of 2019 and it has been really excellent so far. The grip and clip are also outstanding.

### Canon EF 28-70mm f/2.8 L USM

{% include images/center.html src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/28-70.jpg" %}

While this lens is incredibly heavy, I found a second hand one for a reasonable price and I am very pleased with the quality of photos I am getting with it. Fully deserves its reputation.

### Canon EF 17-40mm f/4 L USM

{% include images/center.html src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/17-40.jpg" %}

I picked this one up at the same time I got the 28-70 and the 5D body. When I was shooting my old Canon 1000D (APS-C sensor) I used the Canon 10-22mm EF-S lens and I would have missed it. I have really enjoyed using this one. ([MPB](http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpb.com%2Fen-uk%2Fused-equipment%2Fused-photo-and-video%2Fused-lenses%2Fused-canon-fit-lenses%2Fcanon-ef-17-40mm-f-4-l-usm%2F))

### Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM

{% include images/center.html src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/70-300.jpg" %}

This is a great telephoto zoom that doesn't break the bank or your back. I am consistently amazed at the image stablisation. I carried this over from the 1000D so lost a little bit of equivalent zoom but at 300mm it is still more than enough.

### Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II

{% include images/center.html src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/50.jpg" %}

The renowned budget 50mm has been in my bag since almost the beginning. It will soon be time to pass it on to someone else and switch to either [the new version](http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canon.co.uk%2Flenses%2Fef-50mm-f-1-8-stm-lens%2F) (which has acquired USM) or a used f/1.4. ([MPB](http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpb.com%2Fen-uk%2Fused-equipment%2Fused-photo-and-video%2Fused-lenses%2Fused-canon-fit-lenses%2Fcanon-ef-50mm-f-1-8-ii%2F))

### Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM

{% include images/center.html src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/40.jpg" %}

The tiny "pancake" lens is great for "normal" perspectives, I love shooting landscapes outside with it. If you pop it on and take the battery grip off, also super inconspicuous. STM is a great compromise as it is quiet and pretty fast, and small enough to fit in the package. ([MPB](http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpb.com%2Fen-uk%2Fused-equipment%2Fused-photo-and-video%2Fused-lenses%2Fused-canon-fit-lenses%2Fcanon-ef-40mm-f-2-8-stm%2F))

### Manfrotto ProLight backpack RedBee-310

{% include images/center.html src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/backpack.jpg" %}

When I bought the 5D body I needed a bigger camera bag - that much weight wouldn't work on the over-the-shoulder bag I used to have. The requirements were pretty simple - comfortable, big enough for everything on this page and a bit more, side access, quick camera access, won't break the bank. Turns out it's quite tricky to do that all in one bag, but this one does the job.
