<h1><a href="/">Chris Alexander</a></h1>
<p class="subheading">About</p>

<p>I am an engineer living and working in Surrey. I have previously worked on web and desktop software applications, and I currently build and maintain simulation technology and infrastructure for the local Formula 1 team. I have a Masters degree in Applied Robotics from the University of Reading.</p>

<p>My approach to engineering is a sharp focus on the customer and their problem, combined with a pragmatic, less-is-more perspective. I fight complexity and inefficiency with logical componentisation, self-documentation and convention.</p>

<p>My interests outside work include music and photography, as well as tinkering with robots here and there.</p>
